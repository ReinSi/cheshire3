Fall of the Roman Empire
========================

The unity of the Roman Empire was from this point a fiction, as graphically
revealed by Diocletian's division of authority among four "co-emperors",
the Tetrarchy. Order was shaken again soon after, but was restored by
Constantine, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity, and who
established Constantinople as the new capital of the eastern empire. During
the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties, the Empire was
divided along an east-west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople
and Rome. The reign of Julian, who attempted to restore Classical Roman and
Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian
emperors. Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule over both East and West,
died in 395 AD after making Christianity the official state religion.

Beginning in the late 4th century, the Empire began to disintegrate as
barbarians from the north overwhelmed the control of Christian Rome. Most
chronologies place the end of the Western empire in 476, when Romulus Augustus
was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer. The empire in the
East—known today as the Byzantine Empire, but referred to in its time as the
"Roman Empire" or by various other names—ended in 1453 with the death of
Constantine XI and the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks.
