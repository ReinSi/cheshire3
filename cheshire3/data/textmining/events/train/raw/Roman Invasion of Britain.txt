Roman Invasion of Britain
=========================

Claudius also proceeded with the conquest and colonisation of Britain (in 43),
and incorporated more Eastern provinces into the empire. He ordered the
construction of a winter port for Rome, at Ostia Antica, thereby providing a
place for grain from other parts of the Empire to be brought in inclement
weather.

After preliminary low-scale invasions of Britain, the Romans invaded Britain
in force in 43 AD, forcing their way inland through several battles against
British tribes, including the Battle of the Medway, the Battle of the Thames,
the Battle of Caer Caradoc and the Battle of Mona. Following a general
uprising in which the Britons sacked Colchester,[260] St Albans[261] and
London, the Romans suppressed the rebellion in the Battle of Watling Street
and went on to push as far north as central Scotland in the Battle of Mons
Graupius. Tribes in modern-day Scotland and Northern England repeatedly
rebelled against Roman rule and two military bases were established in
Britannia to protect against rebellion and incursions from the north, from
which Roman troops built and manned Hadrian's Wall.
