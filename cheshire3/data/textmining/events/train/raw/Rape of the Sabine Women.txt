Rape of the Sabine Women
========================

The first campaigns that were fought by the Romans in this legendary account
are the wars with various Latin cities and the Sabines after the Rape of the
Sabine Women. According to Livy, the Latin village of Caenina responded to the
event first by invading Roman territory, but were routed and their village
captured. The Latins of Antemnae and those of Crustumerium were defeated next
in a similar fashion. The remaining main body of the Sabines attacked Rome and
briefly captured the citadel, but were then convinced to conclude a treaty
with the Romans under which the Sabines became Roman citizens.

There was a further war in the 8th century BC against Fidenae and Veii. In
the 7th century BC there was a war with Alba Longa, a second war with Fidenae
and Veii and a second Sabine War. Ancus Marcius led Rome to victory against
the Latins and, according to the Fasti Triumphales, over the Veientes and
Sabines also.
