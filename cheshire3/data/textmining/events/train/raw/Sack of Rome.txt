Sack of Rome
============

By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes had begun invading Italy from the north as
their culture expanded throughout Europe. Most of this was unknown to the
Romans at this time, who still had purely local security concerns, but the
Romans were alerted when a particularly warlike tribe, the Senones, invaded
the Etruscan province of Siena from the north and attacked the town of
Clusium, not far from Rome's sphere of influence. The Clusians, overwhelmed
by the size of the enemy in numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help.
Perhaps unintentionally the Romans found themselves not just in conflict with
the Senones, but their primary target. The Romans met them in pitched battle
at the Battle of the Allia around 390â€“387 BC. The Gauls, under their chieftain
Brennus, defeated the Roman army of around 15,000 troops and proceeded to
pursue the fleeing Romans back to Rome itself and partially sacked the town
before being either driven off or bought off.

Now that the Romans and Gauls had blooded one another, intermittent warfare
was to continue between the two in Italy for more than two centuries,
including the Battle of the Allia, the Battle of Lake Vadimo, the Battle of
Faesulae in 225 BC, the Battle of Telamon in 224 BC, the Battle of Clastidium
in 222 BC, the Battle of Cremona in 200 BC, the Battle of Mutina in 194 BC,
the Battle of Arausio in 105 BC, and the Battle of Vercellae in 101 BC. The
Celtic problem would not be resolved for Rome until the final subjugation of
all Gaul following the Battle of Alesia in 52 BC.
