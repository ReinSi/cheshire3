<stru>Life And Adventures Of Martin Chuzzlewit



by Charles Dickens</stru>







<stru>PREFACE



What is exaggeration to one class of minds and perceptions,

is plain truth to another.  That which is commonly called a long-sight,

perceives in a prospect innumerable features and bearings

non-existent to a short-sighted person.  I sometimes ask myself

whether there may occasionally be a difference of this kind between

some writers and some readers; whether it is ALWAYS the writer

who colours highly, or whether it is now and then the reader

whose eye for colour is a little dull?



On this head of exaggeration I have a positive experience, more

curious than the speculation I have just set down.  It is this:

I have never touched a character precisely from the life, but some

counterpart of that character has incredulously asked me: "Now

really, did I ever really, see one like it?"



All the Pecksniff family upon earth are quite agreed, I believe,

that Mr. Pecksniff is an exaggeration, and that no such character

ever existed.  I will not offer any plea on his behalf to so

powerful and genteel a body, but will make a remark on the

character of Jonas Chuzzlewit.



I conceive that the sordid coarseness and brutality of Jonas

would be unnatural, if there had been nothing in his early

education, and in the precept and example always before him,

to engender and develop the vices that make him odious.  But,

so born and so bred, admired for that which made him hateful,

and justified from his cradle in cunning, treachery, and avarice;

I claim him as the legitimate issue of the father upon whom those

vices are seen to recoil.  And I submit that their recoil upon

that old man, in his unhonoured age, is not a mere piece of

poetical justice, but is the extreme exposition of a direct truth.



I make this comment, and solicit the reader's attention to it in

his or her consideration of this tale, because nothing is more

common in real life than a want of profitable reflection on the

causes of many vices and crimes that awaken the general horror.

What is substantially true of families in this respect, is true

of a whole commonwealth.  As we sow, we reap.  Let the reader go

into the children's side of any prison in England, or, I grieve

to add, of many workhouses, and judge whether those are monsters

who disgrace our streets, people our hulks and penitentiaries, and

overcrowd our penal colonies, or are creatures whom we have

deliberately suffered to be bred for misery and ruin.



The American portion of this story is in no other respect a

caricature than as it is an exhibition, for the most part (Mr.

Bevan expected), of a ludicrous side, ONLY, of the American

character--of that side which was, four-and-twenty years ago,

from its nature, the most obtrusive, and the most likely to be

seen by such travellers as Young Martin and Mark Tapley.  As I

had never, in writing fiction, had any disposition to soften what

is ridiculous or wrong at home, so I then hoped that the

good-humored people of the United States would not be generally

disposed to quarrel with me for carrying the same usage abroad.

I am happy to believe that my confidence in that great nation was

not misplaced.



When this book was first published, I was given to understand, by

some authorities, that the Watertoast Association and eloquence

were beyond all bounds of belief.  Therefore I record the fact

that all that portion of Martin Chuzzlewit's experiences is a

literal paraphrase of some reports of public proceedings in the

United States (especially of the proceedings of a certain Brandywine

Association), which were printed in the Times Newspaper in June

and July, 1843--at about the time when I was engaged in writing

those parts of the book; and which remain on the file of the Times

Newspaper, of course.



In all my writings, I hope I have taken every available opportunity

of showing the want of sanitary improvements in the neglected

dwellings of the poor.  Mrs. Sarah Gamp was, four-and-twenty years

ago, a fair representation of the hired attendant on the poor in

sickness.  The hospitals of London were, in many respects, noble

Institutions; in others, very defective.  I think it not the least

among the instances of their mismanagement, that Mrs. Betsey Prig

was a fair specimen of a Hospital Nurse; and that the Hospitals,

with their means and funds, should have left it to private humanity

and enterprise, to enter on an attempt to improve that class of

persons--since, greatly improved through the agency of good women.</stru>







<stru>POSTSCRIPT



At a Public Dinner given to me on Saturday the 18th of April, 1868,

in the city of New York, by two hundred representatives of the Press

of the United States of America, I made the following observations,

among others:--



"So much of my voice has lately been heard in the land, that I

might have been contented with troubling you no further from my

present standing-point, were it not a duty with which I henceforth

charge myself, not only here but on every suitable occasion,

whatsoever and wheresoever, to express my high and grateful sense

of my second reception in America, and to bear my honest testimony

to the national generosity and magnanimity.  Also, to declare how

astounded I have been by the amazing changes I have seen around me

on every side--changes moral, changes physical, changes in the

amount of land subdued and peopled, changes in the rise of vast

new cities, changes in the growth of older cities almost out of

recognition, changes in the graces and amenities of life, changes

in the Press, without whose advancement no advancement can take

place anywhere.  Nor am I, believe me, so arrogant as to suppose

that in five-and-twenty years there have been no changes in me,

and that I had nothing to learn and no extreme impressions to

correct when I was here first.  And this brings me to a point on

which I have, ever since I landed in the United States last November,

observed a strict silence, though sometimes tempted to break it,

but in reference to which I will, with your good leave, take you

into my confidence now.  Even the Press, being human, may be

sometimes mistaken or misinformed, and I rather think that I have

in one or two rare instances observed its information to be not

strictly accurate with reference to myself.  Indeed, I have, now

and again, been more surprised by printed news that I have read of

myself, than by any printed news that I have ever read in my present

state of existence.  Thus, the vigour and perseverance with which

I have for some months past been collecting materials for, and

hammering away at, a new book on America has much astonished me;

seeing that all that time my declaration has been perfectly well

known to my publishers on both sides of the Atlantic, that no

consideration on earth would induce me to write one.  But what

I have intended, what I have resolved upon (and this is the

confidence I seek to place in you), is, on my return to England,

in my own person, in my own Journal, to bear, for the behoof of my

countrymen, such testimony to the gigantic changes in this country

as I have hinted at to-night.  Also, to record that wherever I have

been, in the smallest places equally with the largest, I have been

received with unsurpassable politeness, delicacy, sweet temper,

hospitality, consideration, and with unsurpassable respect for

the privacy daily enforced upon me by the nature of my avocation

here and the state of my health.  This testimony, so long as I live,

and so long as my descendants have any legal right in my books,

I shall cause to be republished, as an appendix to every copy of

those two books of mine in which I have referred to America.

And this I will do and cause to be done, not in mere love and

thankfulness, but because I regard it as an act of plain justice

and honour."



I said these words with the greatest earnestness that I could lay

upon them, and I repeat them in print here with equal earnestness.

So long as this book shall last, I hope that they will form a part

of it, and will be fairly read as inseparable from my experiences

and impressions of America.

<title>CHAPTER ONE INTRODUCTORY, CONCERNING THE PEDIGREE OF THE CHUZZLEWIT FAMILY</title>

<p pid="1" id="MC.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="MC.c1.s1">As no lady or gentleman, with any claims to polite breeding, can possibly sympathize with the Chuzzlewit Family without being first assured of the extreme antiquity of the race, it is a great satisfaction to know that it undoubtedly descended in a direct line from Adam and Eve; and was, in the very earliest times, closely connected with the agricultural interest.</s> <s sid="2" id="MC.c1.s2">If it should ever be urged by grudging and malicious persons, that a Chuzzlewit, in any period of the family history, displayed an overweening amount of family pride, surely the weakness will be considered not only pardonable but laudable, when the immense superiority of the house to the rest of mankind, in respect of this its ancient origin, is taken into account.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c1.p2"><s sid="3" id="MC.c1.s3">It is remarkable that as there was, in the oldest family of which we have any record, a murderer and a vagabond, so we never fail to meet, in the records of all old families, with innumerable repetitions of the same phase of character.</s> <s sid="4" id="MC.c1.s4">Indeed, it may be laid down as a general principle, that the more extended the ancestry, the greater the amount of violence and vagabondism; for in ancient days those two amusements, combining a wholesome excitement with a promising means of repairing shattered fortunes, were at once the ennobling pursuit and the healthful recreation of the Quality of this land.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c1.p3"><s sid="5" id="MC.c1.s5">Consequently, it is a source of inexpressible comfort and happiness to find, that in various periods of our history, the Chuzzlewits were actively connected with divers slaughterous conspiracies and bloody frays.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c1.s6">It is further recorded of them, that being clad from head to heel in steel of proof, they did on many occasions lead their leather-jerkined soldiers to the death with invincible courage, and afterwards return home gracefully to their relations and friends.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="MC.c1.p4"><s sid="7" id="MC.c1.s7">There can be no doubt that at least one Chuzzlewit came over with William the Conqueror.</s> <s sid="8" id="MC.c1.s8">It does not appear that this illustrious ancestor 'came over' that monarch, to employ the vulgar phrase, at any subsequent period; inasmuch as the Family do not seem to have been ever greatly distinguished by the possession of landed estate.</s> <s sid="9" id="MC.c1.s9">And it is well known that for the bestowal of that kind of property upon his favourites, the liberality and gratitude of the Norman were as remarkable as those virtues are usually found to be in great men when they give away what belongs to other people.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="MC.c1.p5"><s sid="10" id="MC.c1.s10">Perhaps in this place the history may pause to congratulate itself upon the enormous amount of bravery, wisdom, eloquence, virtue, gentle birth, and true nobility, that appears to have come into England with the Norman Invasion: an amount which the genealogy of every ancient family lends its aid to swell, and which would beyond all question have been found to be just as great, and to the full as prolific in giving birth to long lines of chivalrous descendants, boastful of their origin, even though William the Conqueror had been William the Conquered; a change of circumstances which, it is quite certain, would have made no manner of difference in this respect.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="MC.c1.p6"><s sid="11" id="MC.c1.s11">There was unquestionably a Chuzzlewit in the Gunpowder Plot, if indeed the arch-traitor, Fawkes himself, were not a scion of this remarkable stock; as he might easily have been, supposing another Chuzzlewit to have emigrated to Spain in the previous generation, and there intermarried with a Spanish lady, by whom he had issue, one olive-complexioned son.</s> <s sid="12" id="MC.c1.s12">This probable conjecture is strengthened, if not absolutely confirmed, by a fact which cannot fail to be interesting to those who are curious in tracing the progress of hereditary tastes through the lives of their unconscious inheritors.</s> <s sid="13" id="MC.c1.s13">It is a notable circumstance that in these later times, many Chuzzlewits, being unsuccessful in other pursuits, have, without the smallest rational hope of enriching themselves, or any conceivable reason, set up as coal-merchants; and have, month after month, continued gloomily to watch a small stock of coals, without in any one instance negotiating with a purchaser.</s> <s sid="14" id="MC.c1.s14">The remarkable similarity between this course of proceeding and that adopted by their Great Ancestor beneath the vaults of the Parliament House at Westminster, is too obvious and too full of interest, to stand in need of comment.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="MC.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="MC.c1.s15">It is also clearly proved by the oral traditions of the Family, that there existed, at some one period of its history which is not distinctly stated, a matron of such destructive principles, and so familiarized to the use and composition of inflammatory and combustible engines, that she was called <qs/>'The Match Maker;'<qe/> by which nickname and byword she is recognized in the Family legends to this day.</s> <s sid="16" id="MC.c1.s16">Surely there can be no reasonable doubt that this was the Spanish lady, the mother of Chuzzlewit Fawkes.</s> </p><p pid="8" id="MC.c1.p8"><s sid="17" id="MC.c1.s17">But there is one other piece of evidence, bearing immediate reference to their close connection with this memorable event in English History, which must carry conviction, even to a mind (if such a mind there be) remaining unconvinced by these presumptive proofs.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="MC.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="MC.c1.s18">There was, within a few years, in the possession of a highly respectable and in every way credible and unimpeachable member of the Chuzzlewit Family (for his bitterest enemy never dared to hint at his being otherwise than a wealthy man), a dark lantern of undoubted antiquity; rendered still more interesting by being, in shape and pattern, extremely like such as are in use at the present day.</s> <s sid="19" id="MC.c1.s19">Now this gentleman, since deceased, was at all times ready to make oath, and did again and again set forth upon his solemn asseveration, that he had frequently heard his grandmother say, when contemplating this venerable relic, <qs/>'Aye, aye!</s> <s sid="20" id="MC.c1.s20">This was carried by my fourth son on the fifth of November, when he was a Guy Fawkes.'<qe/></s> <s sid="21" id="MC.c1.s21">These remarkable words wrought (as well they might) a strong impression on his mind, and he was in the habit of repeating them very often.</s> <s sid="22" id="MC.c1.s22">The just interpretation which they bear, and the conclusion to which they lead, are triumphant and irresistible.</s> <s sid="23" id="MC.c1.s23">The old lady, naturally strong-minded, was nevertheless frail and fading; she was notoriously subject to that confusion of ideas, or, to say the least, of speech, to which age and garrulity are liable.</s> <s sid="24" id="MC.c1.s24">The slight, the very slight, confusion apparent in these expressions is manifest, and is ludicrously easy of correction.</s> <s sid="25" id="MC.c1.s25"><qs/>'Aye, aye,'<qe/><sls/> quoth she, and it will be observed that no emendation whatever is necessary to be made in these two initiative remarks, <sle/><qs/>'Aye, aye!</s> <s sid="26" id="MC.c1.s26">This lantern was carried by my forefather'<qe/><sls/>--not fourth son, which is preposterous--<sle/><qs/>'on the fifth of November.</s> <s sid="27" id="MC.c1.s27">And HE was Guy Fawkes.'<qe/></s> <s sid="28" id="MC.c1.s28">Here we have a remark at once consistent, clear, natural, and in strict accordance with the character of the speaker.</s> <s sid="29" id="MC.c1.s29">Indeed the anecdote is so plainly susceptible of this meaning and no other, that it would be hardly worth recording in its original state, were it not a proof of what may be (and very often is) affected not only in historical prose but in imaginative poetry, by the exercise of a little ingenious labour on the part of a commentator.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="MC.c1.p10"><s sid="30" id="MC.c1.s30">It has been said that there is no instance, in modern times, of a Chuzzlewit having been found on terms of intimacy with the Great.</s> <s sid="31" id="MC.c1.s31">But here again the sneering detractors who weave such miserable figments from their malicious brains, are stricken dumb by evidence.</s> <s sid="32" id="MC.c1.s32">For letters are yet in the possession of various branches of the family, from which it distinctly appears, being stated in so many words, that one Diggory Chuzzlewit was in the habit of perpetually dining with Duke Humphrey.</s> <s sid="33" id="MC.c1.s33">So constantly was he a guest at that nobleman's table, indeed; and so unceasingly were His Grace's hospitality and companionship forced, as it were, upon him; that we find him uneasy, and full of constraint and reluctance; writing his friends to the effect that if they fail to do so and so by bearer, he will have no choice but to dine again with Duke Humphrey; and expressing himself in a very marked and extraordinary manner as one surfeited of High Life and Gracious Company.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="MC.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="MC.c1.s34">It has been rumoured, and it is needless to say the rumour originated in the same base quarters, that a certain male Chuzzlewit, whose birth must be admitted to be involved in some obscurity, was of very mean and low descent.</s> <s sid="35" id="MC.c1.s35">How stands the proof?</s> <s sid="36" id="MC.c1.s36">When the son of that individual, to whom the secret of his father's birth was supposed to have been communicated by his father in his lifetime, lay upon his deathbed, this question was put to him in a distinct, solemn, and formal way:</s> <s sid="37" id="MC.c1.s37"><qs/>'Toby Chuzzlewit, who was your grandfather?'<qe/></s> <s sid="38" id="MC.c1.s38">To which he, with his last breath, no less distinctly, solemnly, and formally replied: and his words were taken down at the time, and signed by six witnesses, each with his name and address in full:</s> <s sid="39" id="MC.c1.s39"><qs/>'The Lord No Zoo.'<qe/></s> <s sid="40" id="MC.c1.s40">It may be said--it HAS been said, for human wickedness has no limits--that there is no Lord of that name, and that among the titles which have become extinct, none at all resembling this, in sound even, is to be discovered.</s> <s sid="41" id="MC.c1.s41">But what is the irresistible inference?</s> <s sid="42" id="MC.c1.s42">Rejecting a theory broached by some well-meaning but mistaken persons, that this Mr Toby Chuzzlewit's grandfather, to judge from his name, must surely have been a Mandarin (which is wholly insupportable, for there is no pretence of his grandmother ever having been out of this country, or of any Mandarin having been in it within some years of his father's birth; except those in the tea-shops, which cannot for a moment be regarded as having any bearing on the question, one way or other), rejecting this hypothesis, is it not manifest that Mr Toby Chuzzlewit had either received the name imperfectly from his father, or that he had forgotten it, or that he had mispronounced it? and that even at the recent period in question, the Chuzzlewits were connected by a bend sinister, or kind of heraldic over-the-left, with some unknown noble and illustrious House?</s> </p><p pid="12" id="MC.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="MC.c1.s43">From documentary evidence, yet preserved in the family, the fact is clearly established that in the comparatively modern days of the Diggory Chuzzlewit before mentioned, one of its members had attained to very great wealth and influence.</s> <s sid="44" id="MC.c1.s44">Throughout such fragments of his correspondence as have escaped the ravages of the moths (who, in right of their extensive absorption of the contents of deeds and papers, may be called the general registers of the Insect World), we find him making constant reference to an uncle, in respect of whom he would seem to have entertained great expectations, as he was in the habit of seeking to propitiate his favour by presents of plate, jewels, books, watches, and other valuable articles.</s> <s sid="45" id="MC.c1.s45">Thus, he writes on one occasion to his brother in reference to a gravy-spoon, the brother's property, which he (Diggory) would appear to have borrowed or otherwise possessed himself of:</s> <s sid="46" id="MC.c1.s46"><qs/>'Do not be angry, I have parted with it--to my uncle.'<qe/></s> <s sid="47" id="MC.c1.s47">On another occasion he expresses himself in a similar manner with regard to a child's mug which had been entrusted to him to get repaired.</s> <s sid="48" id="MC.c1.s48">On another occasion he says, <qs/>'I have bestowed upon that irresistible uncle of mine everything I ever possessed.'<qe/></s> <s sid="49" id="MC.c1.s49">And that he was in the habit of paying long and constant visits to this gentleman at his mansion, if, indeed, he did not wholly reside there, is manifest from the following sentence:</s> <s sid="50" id="MC.c1.s50"><qs/>'With the exception of the suit of clothes I carry about with me, the whole of my wearing apparel is at present at my uncle's.'<qe/></s> <s sid="51" id="MC.c1.s51">This gentleman's patronage and influence must have been very extensive, for his nephew writes, <qs/>'His interest is too high'<qe/><sss/>--'It is too much' --<sse/><qs/>'It is tremendous'<qe/>--and the like.</s> <s sid="52" id="MC.c1.s52">Still it does not appear (which is strange) to have procured for him any lucrative post at court or elsewhere, or to have conferred upon him any other distinction than that which was necessarily included in the countenance of so great a man, and the being invited by him to certain entertainment's, so splendid and costly in their nature, that he calls them <qs/>'Golden Balls.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="MC.c1.p13"><s sid="53" id="MC.c1.s53">It is needless to multiply instances of the high and lofty station, and the vast importance of the Chuzzlewits, at different periods.</s> <s sid="54" id="MC.c1.s54">If it came within the scope of reasonable probability that further proofs were required, they might be heaped upon each other until they formed an Alps of testimony, beneath which the boldest scepticism should be crushed and beaten flat.</s> <s sid="55" id="MC.c1.s55">As a goodly tumulus is already collected, and decently battened up above the Family grave, the present chapter is content to leave it as it is: merely adding, by way of a final spadeful, that many Chuzzlewits, both male and female, are proved to demonstration, on the faith of letters written by their own mothers, to have had chiselled noses, undeniable chins, forms that might have served the sculptor for a model, exquisitely-turned limbs and polished foreheads of so transparent a texture that the blue veins might be seen branching off in various directions, like so many roads on an ethereal map.</s> <s sid="56" id="MC.c1.s56">This fact in itself, though it had been a solitary one, would have utterly settled and clenched the business in hand; for it is well known, on the authority of all the books which treat of such matters, that every one of these phenomena, but especially that of the chiselling, are invariably peculiar to, and only make themselves apparent in, persons of the very best condition.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="MC.c1.p14"><s sid="57" id="MC.c1.s57">This history having, to its own perfect satisfaction, (and, consequently, to the full contentment of all its readers,) proved the Chuzzlewits to have had an origin, and to have been at one time or other of an importance which cannot fail to render them highly improving and acceptable acquaintance to all right-minded individuals, may now proceed in earnest with its task.</s> <s sid="58" id="MC.c1.s58">And having shown that they must have had, by reason of their ancient birth, a pretty large share in the foundation and increase of the human family, it will one day become its province to submit, that such of its members as shall be introduced in these pages, have still many counterparts and prototypes in the Great World about us.</s> <s sid="59" id="MC.c1.s59">At present it contents itself with remarking, in a general way, on this head:</s> <s sid="60" id="MC.c1.s60">Firstly, that it may be safely asserted, and yet without implying any direct participation in the Manboddo doctrine touching the probability of the human race having once been monkeys, that men do play very strange and extraordinary tricks.</s> <s sid="61" id="MC.c1.s61">Secondly, and yet without trenching on the Blumenbach theory as to the descendants of Adam having a vast number of qualities which belong more particularly to swine than to any other class of animals in the creation, that some men certainly are remarkable for taking uncommon good care of themselves.</s> </p></div>

<title>CHAPTER TWO WHEREIN CERTAIN PERSONS ARE PRESENTED TO THE READER, WITH WHOM HE MAY, IF HE PLEASE, BECOME BETTER ACQUAINTED</title>

<p pid="1" id="MC.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="MC.c2.s1">It was pretty late in the autumn of the year, when the declining sun struggling through the mist which had obscured it all day, looked brightly down upon a little Wiltshire village, within an easy journey of the fair old town of Salisbury.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c2.p2"><s sid="2" id="MC.c2.s2">Like a sudden flash of memory or spirit kindling up the mind of an old man, it shed a glory upon the scene, in which its departed youth and freshness seemed to live again.</s> <s sid="3" id="MC.c2.s3">The wet grass sparkled in the light; the scanty patches of verdure in the hedges--where a few green twigs yet stood together bravely, resisting to the last the tyranny of nipping winds and early frosts--took heart and brightened up; the stream which had been dull and sullen all day long, broke out into a cheerful smile; the birds began to chirp and twitter on the naked boughs, as though the hopeful creatures half believed that winter had gone by, and spring had come already.</s> <s sid="4" id="MC.c2.s4">The vane upon the tapering spire of the old church glistened from its lofty station in sympathy with the general gladness; and from the ivy-shaded windows such gleams of light shone back upon the glowing sky, that it seemed as if the quiet buildings were the hoarding-place of twenty summers, and all their ruddiness and warmth were stored within.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c2.p3"><s sid="5" id="MC.c2.s5">Even those tokens of the season which emphatically whispered of the coming winter, graced the landscape, and, for the moment, tinged its livelier features with no oppressive air of sadness.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c2.s6">The fallen leaves, with which the ground was strewn, gave forth a pleasant fragrance, and subduing all harsh sounds of distant feet and wheels created a repose in gentle unison with the light scattering of seed hither and thither by the distant husbandman, and with the noiseless passage of the plough as it turned up the rich brown earth, and wrought a graceful pattern in the stubbled fields.</s> <s sid="7" id="MC.c2.s7">On the motionless branches of some trees, autumn berries hung like clusters of coral beads, as in those fabled orchards where the fruits were jewels; others stripped of all their garniture, stood, each the centre of its little heap of bright red leaves, watching their slow decay; others again, still wearing theirs, had them all crunched and crackled up, as though they had been burnt; about the stems of some were piled, in ruddy mounds, the apples they had borne that year; while others (hardy evergreens this class) showed somewhat stern and gloomy in their vigour, as charged by nature with the admonition that it is not to her more sensitive and joyous favourites she grants the longest term of life.</s> <s sid="8" id="MC.c2.s8">Still athwart their darker boughs, the sunbeams struck out paths of deeper gold; and the red light, mantling in among their swarthy branches, used them as foils to set its brightness off, and aid the lustre of the dying day.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="MC.c2.p4"><s sid="9" id="MC.c2.s9">A moment, and its glory was no more.</s> <s sid="10" id="MC.c2.s10">The sun went down beneath the long dark lines of hill and cloud which piled up in the west an airy city, wall heaped on wall, and battlement on battlement; the light was all withdrawn; the shining church turned cold and dark; the stream forgot to smile; the birds were silent; and the gloom of winter dwelt on everything.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="MC.c3.p1"><s sid="1" id="MC.c3.s1">Mention has been already made more than once, of a certain Dragon who swung and creaked complainingly before the village alehouse door.</s> <s sid="2" id="MC.c3.s2">A faded, and an ancient dragon he was; and many a wintry storm of rain, snow, sleet, and hail, had changed his colour from a gaudy blue to a faint lack-lustre shade of grey.</s> <s sid="3" id="MC.c3.s3">But there he hung; rearing, in a state of monstrous imbecility, on his hind legs; waxing, with every month that passed, so much more dim and shapeless, that as you gazed at him on one side of the sign-board it seemed as if he must be gradually melting through it, and coming out upon the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c3.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="MC.c3.s4">He was a courteous and considerate dragon, too; or had been in his distincter days; for in the midst of his rampant feebleness, he kept one of his forepaws near his nose, as though he would say, <qs/>'Don't mind me--it's only my fun;'<qe/> while he held out the other in polite and hospitable entreaty.</s> <s sid="5" id="MC.c3.s5">Indeed it must be conceded to the whole brood of dragons of modern times, that they have made a great advance in civilisation and refinement.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c3.s6">They no longer demand a beautiful virgin for breakfast every morning, with as much regularity as any tame single gentleman expects his hot roll, but rest content with the society of idle bachelors and roving married men; and they are now remarkable rather for holding aloof from the softer sex and discouraging their visits (especially on Saturday nights), than for rudely insisting on their company without any reference to their inclinations, as they are known to have done in days of yore.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="MC.c3.p3"><s sid="7" id="MC.c3.s7">Nor is this tribute to the reclaimed animals in question so wide a digression into the realms of Natural History as it may, at first sight, appear to be; for the present business of these pages in with the dragon who had his retreat in Mr Pecksniff's neighbourhood, and that courteous animal being already on the carpet, there is nothing in the way of its immediate transaction.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="MC.c3.p4"><s sid="8" id="MC.c3.s8">For many years, then, he had swung and creaked, and flapped himself about, before the two windows of the best bedroom of that house of entertainment to which he lent his name; but never in all his swinging, creaking, and flapping, had there been such a stir within its dingy precincts, as on the evening next after that upon which the incidents, detailed in the last chapter occurred; when there was such a hurrying up and down stairs of feet, such a glancing of lights, such a whispering of voices, such a smoking and sputtering of wood newly lighted in a damp chimney, such an airing of linen, such a scorching smell of hot warming-pans, such a domestic bustle and to-do, in short, as never dragon, griffin, unicorn, or other animal of that species presided over, since they first began to interest themselves in household affairs.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="MC.c3.p11"><s sid="26" id="MC.c3.s26">The mistress of the Blue Dragon was in outward appearance just what a landlady should be: broad, buxom, comfortable, and good looking, with a face of clear red and white, which, by its jovial aspect, at once bore testimony to her hearty participation in the good things of the larder and cellar, and to their thriving and healthful influences.</s> <s sid="27" id="MC.c3.s27">She was a widow, but years ago had passed through her state of weeds, and burst into flower again; and in full bloom she had continued ever since; and in full bloom she was now; with roses on her ample skirts, and roses on her bodice, roses in her cap, roses in her cheeks,--aye, and roses, worth the gathering too, on her lips, for that matter.</s> <s sid="28" id="MC.c3.s28">She had still a bright black eye, and jet black hair; was comely, dimpled, plump, and tight as a gooseberry; and though she was not exactly what the world calls young, you may make an affidavit, on trust, before any mayor or magistrate in Christendom, that there are a great many young ladies in the world (blessings on them one and all!) whom you wouldn't like half as well, or admire half as much, as the beaming hostess of the Blue Dragon.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="MC.c3.p12"><s sid="29" id="MC.c3.s29">As this fair matron sat beside the fire, she glanced occasionally with all the pride of ownership, about the room; which was a large apartment, such as one may see in country places, with a low roof and a sunken flooring, all downhill from the door, and a descent of two steps on the inside so exquisitely unexpected, that strangers, despite the most elaborate cautioning, usually dived in head first, as into a plunging-bath.</s> <s sid="30" id="MC.c3.s30">It was none of your frivolous and preposterously bright bedrooms, where nobody can close an eye with any kind of propriety or decent regard to the association of ideas; but it was a good, dull, leaden, drowsy place, where every article of furniture reminded you that you came there to sleep, and that you were expected to go to sleep.</s> <s sid="31" id="MC.c3.s31">There was no wakeful reflection of the fire there, as in your modern chambers, which upon the darkest nights have a watchful consciousness of French polish; the old Spanish mahogany winked at it now and then, as a dozing cat or dog might, nothing more.</s> <s sid="32" id="MC.c3.s32">The very size and shape, and hopeless immovability of the bedstead, and wardrobe, and in a minor degree of even the chairs and tables, provoked sleep; they were plainly apoplectic and disposed to snore.</s> <s sid="33" id="MC.c3.s33">There were no staring portraits to remonstrate with you for being lazy; no round-eyed birds upon the curtains, disgustingly wide awake, and insufferably prying.</s> <s sid="34" id="MC.c3.s34">The thick neutral hangings, and the dark blinds, and the heavy heap of bed-clothes, were all designed to hold in sleep, and act as nonconductors to the day and getting up.</s> <s sid="35" id="MC.c3.s35">Even the old stuffed fox upon the top of the wardrobe was devoid of any spark of vigilance, for his glass eye had fallen out, and he slumbered as he stood.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="MC.c3.p14"><s sid="38" id="MC.c3.s38">She was very young; apparently no more than seventeen; timid and shrinking in her manner, and yet with a greater share of self possession and control over her emotions than usually belongs to a far more advanced period of female life.</s> <s sid="39" id="MC.c3.s39">This she had abundantly shown, but now, in her tending of the sick gentleman.</s> <s sid="40" id="MC.c3.s40">She was short in stature; and her figure was slight, as became her years; but all the charms of youth and maidenhood set it off, and clustered on her gentle brow.</s> <s sid="41" id="MC.c3.s41">Her face was very pale, in part no doubt from recent agitation.</s> <s sid="42" id="MC.c3.s42">Her dark brown hair, disordered from the same cause, had fallen negligently from its bonds, and hung upon her neck; for which instance of its waywardness no male observer would have had the heart to blame it.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="MC.c3.p15"><s sid="43" id="MC.c3.s43">Her attire was that of a lady, but extremely plain; and in her manner, even when she sat as still as she did then, there was an indefinable something which appeared to be in kindred with her scrupulously unpretending dress.</s> <s sid="44" id="MC.c3.s44">She had sat, at first looking anxiously towards the bed; but seeing that the patient remained quiet, and was busy with his writing, she had softly moved her chair into its present place; partly, as it seemed, from an instinctive consciousness that he desired to avoid observation; and partly that she might, unseen by him, give some vent to the natural feelings she had hitherto suppressed.</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="MC.c4.p76"><s sid="197" id="MC.c4.s197">In a word, things came to that pass that nearly the whole family sat down before the Blue Dragon, and formally invested it; and Martin Chuzzlewit was in a state of siege.</s> <s sid="198" id="MC.c4.s198">But he resisted bravely; refusing to receive all letters, messages, and parcels; obstinately declining to treat with anybody; and holding out no hope or promise of capitulation.</s> <s sid="199" id="MC.c4.s199">Meantime the family forces were perpetually encountering each other in divers parts of the neighbourhood; and, as no one branch of the Chuzzlewit tree had ever been known to agree with another within the memory of man, there was such a skirmishing, and flouting, and snapping off of heads, in the metaphorical sense of that expression; such a bandying of words and calling of names; such an upturning of noses and wrinkling of brows; such a formal interment of good feelings and violent resurrection of ancient grievances; as had never been known in those quiet parts since the earliest record of their civilized existence.</s> </p>

<p pid="77" id="MC.c4.p77"><s sid="200" id="MC.c4.s200">At length, in utter despair and hopelessness, some few of the belligerents began to speak to each other in only moderate terms of mutual aggravation; and nearly all addressed themselves with a show of tolerable decency to Mr Pecksniff, in recognition of his high character and influential position.</s> <s sid="201" id="MC.c4.s201">Thus, by little and little, they made common cause of Martin Chuzzlewit's obduracy, until it was agreed (if such a word can be used in connection with the Chuzzlewits) that there should be a general council and conference held at Mr Pecksniff's house upon a certain day at noon; which all members of the family who had brought themselves within reach of the summons, were forthwith bidden and invited, solemnly, to attend.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER FIVE CONTAINING A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE INSTALLATION OF MR PECKSNIFF'S NEW PUPIL INTO THE BOSOM OF MR PECKSNIFF'S FAMILY.  WITH ALL THE FESTIVITIES HELD ON THAT OCCASION, AND THE GREAT ENJOYMENT OF MR PINCH</title>

<p pid="1" id="MC.c5.p1"><s sid="1" id="MC.c5.s1">The best of architects and land surveyors kept a horse, in whom the enemies already mentioned more than once in these pages pretended to detect a fanciful resemblance to his master.</s> <s sid="2" id="MC.c5.s2">Not in his outward person, for he was a raw-boned, haggard horse, always on a much shorter allowance of corn than Mr Pecksniff; but in his moral character, wherein, said they, he was full of promise, but of no performance.</s> <s sid="3" id="MC.c5.s3">He was always in a manner, going to go, and never going.</s> <s sid="4" id="MC.c5.s4">When at his slowest rate of travelling he would sometimes lift up his legs so high, and display such mighty action, that it was difficult to believe he was doing less than fourteen miles an hour; and he was for ever so perfectly satisfied with his own speed, and so little disconcerted by opportunities of comparing himself with the fastest trotters, that the illusion was the more difficult of resistance.</s> <s sid="5" id="MC.c5.s5">He was a kind of animal who infused into the breasts of strangers a lively sense of hope, and possessed all those who knew him better with a grim despair.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c5.s6">In what respect, having these points of character, he might be fairly likened to his master, that good man's slanderers only can explain.</s> <s sid="7" id="MC.c5.s7">But it is a melancholy truth, and a deplorable instance of the uncharitableness of the world, that they made the comparison.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c5.p2"><s sid="8" id="MC.c5.s8">In this horse, and the hooded vehicle, whatever its proper name might be, to which he was usually harnessed--it was more like a gig with a tumour than anything else--all Mr Pinch's thoughts and wishes centred, one bright frosty morning; for with this gallant equipage he was about to drive to Salisbury alone, there to meet with the new pupil, and thence to bring him home in triumph.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c5.p3" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="MC.c5.s9">Blessings on thy simple heart, Tom Pinch, how proudly dost thou button up that scanty coat, called by a sad misnomer, for these many years, a 'great' one; and how thoroughly, as with thy cheerful voice thou pleasantly adjurest Sam the hostler <qs/>'not to let him go yet,'<qe/> dost thou believe that quadruped desires to go, and would go if he might!</s> <s sid="10" id="MC.c5.s10">Who could repress a smile--of love for thee, Tom Pinch, and not in jest at thy expense, for thou art poor enough already, Heaven knows--to think that such a holiday as lies before thee should awaken that quick flow and hurry of the spirits, in which thou settest down again, almost untasted, on the kitchen window-sill, that great white mug (put by, by thy own hands, last night, that breakfast might not hold thee late), and layest yonder crust upon the seat beside thee, to be eaten on the road, when thou art calmer in thy high rejoicing!</s> <s sid="11" id="MC.c5.s11">Who, as thou drivest off, a happy, man, and noddest with a grateful lovingness to Pecksniff in his nightcap at his chamber-window, would not cry, <qs/>'Heaven speed thee, Tom, and send that thou wert going off for ever to some quiet home where thou mightst live at peace, and sorrow should not touch thee!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="4" id="MC.c5.p4"><s sid="12" id="MC.c5.s12">What better time for driving, riding, walking, moving through the air by any means, than a fresh, frosty morning, when hope runs cheerily through the veins with the brisk blood, and tingles in the frame from head to foot!</s> <s sid="13" id="MC.c5.s13">This was the glad commencement of a bracing day in early winter, such as may put the languid summer season (speaking of it when it can't be had) to the blush, and shame the spring for being sometimes cold by halves.</s> <s sid="14" id="MC.c5.s14">The sheep-bells rang as clearly in the vigorous air, as if they felt its wholesome influence like living creatures; the trees, in lieu of leaves or blossoms, shed upon the ground a frosty rime that sparkled as it fell, and might have been the dust of diamonds.</s> <s sid="15" id="MC.c5.s15">So it was to Tom.</s> <s sid="16" id="MC.c5.s16">From cottage chimneys, smoke went streaming up high, high, as if the earth had lost its grossness, being so fair, and must not be oppressed by heavy vapour.</s> <s sid="17" id="MC.c5.s17">The crust of ice on the else rippling brook was so transparent, and so thin in texture, that the lively water might of its own free will have stopped--in Tom's glad mind it had--to look upon the lovely morning.</s> <s sid="18" id="MC.c5.s18">And lest the sun should break this charm too eagerly, there moved between him and the ground, a mist like that which waits upon the moon on summer nights--the very same to Tom--and wooed him to dissolve it gently.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="MC.c5.p5" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="MC.c5.s19">Tom Pinch went on; not fast, but with a sense of rapid motion, which did just as well; and as he went, all kinds of things occurred to keep him happy.</s> <s sid="20" id="MC.c5.s20">Thus when he came within sight of the turnpike, and was--oh a long way off!--he saw the tollman's wife, who had that moment checked a waggon, run back into the little house again like mad, to say (she knew) that Mr Pinch was coming up.</s> <s sid="21" id="MC.c5.s21">And she was right, for when he drew within hail of the gate, forth rushed the tollman's children, shrieking in tiny chorus, <qs/>'Mr Pinch!'<qe/> to Tom's intense delight.</s> <s sid="22" id="MC.c5.s22">The very tollman, though an ugly chap in general, and one whom folks were rather shy of handling, came out himself to take the toll, and give him rough good morning; and that with all this, and a glimpse of the family breakfast on a little round table before the fire, the crust Tom Pinch had brought away with him acquired as rich a flavour as though it had been cut from a fairy loaf.</s> </p><p pid="6" id="MC.c5.p6"><s sid="23" id="MC.c5.s23">But there was more than this.</s> <s sid="24" id="MC.c5.s24">It was not only the married people and the children who gave Tom Pinch a welcome as he passed.</s> <s sid="25" id="MC.c5.s25">No, no.</s> <s sid="26" id="MC.c5.s26">Sparkling eyes and snowy breasts came hurriedly to many an upper casement as he clattered by, and gave him back his greeting: not stinted either, but sevenfold, good measure.</s> <s sid="27" id="MC.c5.s27">They were all merry.</s> <s sid="28" id="MC.c5.s28">They all laughed.</s> <s sid="29" id="MC.c5.s29">And some of the wickedest among them even kissed their hands as Tom looked back.</s> <s sid="30" id="MC.c5.s30">For who minded poor Mr Pinch?</s> <s sid="31" id="MC.c5.s31">There was no harm in HIM.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="MC.c5.p7" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="MC.c5.s32">And now the morning grew so fair, and all things were so wide awake and gay, that the sun seeming to say--Tom had no doubt he said--<qs/>'I can't stand it any longer; I must have a look,'<qe/> streamed out in radiant majesty.</s> <s sid="33" id="MC.c5.s33">The mist, too shy and gentle for such lusty company, fled off, quite scared, before it; and as it swept away, the hills and mounds and distant pasture lands, teeming with placid sheep and noisy crows, came out as bright as though they were unrolled bran new for the occasion.</s> <s sid="34" id="MC.c5.s34">In compliment to which discovery, the brook stood still no longer, but ran briskly off to bear the tidings to the water-mill, three miles away.</s> </p><p pid="8" id="MC.c5.p8"><s sid="35" id="MC.c5.s35">Mr Pinch was jogging along, full of pleasant thoughts and cheerful influences, when he saw, upon the path before him, going in the same direction with himself, a traveller on foot, who walked with a light quick step, and sang as he went--for certain in a very loud voice, but not unmusically.</s> <s sid="36" id="MC.c5.s36">He was a young fellow, of some five or six- and-twenty perhaps, and was dressed in such a free and fly-away fashion, that the long ends of his loose red neckcloth were streaming out behind him quite as often as before; and the bunch of bright winter berries in the buttonhole of his velveteen coat was as visible to Mr Pinch's rearward observation, as if he had worn that garment wrong side foremost.</s> <s sid="37" id="MC.c5.s37">He continued to sing with so much energy, that he did not hear the sound of wheels until it was close behind him; when he turned a whimsical face and a very merry pair of blue eyes on Mr Pinch, and checked himself directly.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="MC.c5.p9" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="MC.c5.s38"><qs/>'Why, Mark?'<qe/> said Tom Pinch, stopping.</s> <s sid="39" id="MC.c5.s39"><qs/>'Who'd have thought of seeing you here?</s> <s sid="40" id="MC.c5.s40">Well! this is surprising!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="10" id="MC.c5.p10"><s sid="41" id="MC.c5.s41">Mark touched his hat, and said, with a very sudden decrease of vivacity, that he was going to Salisbury.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="MC.c5.p51"><s sid="146" id="MC.c5.s146">Mr Pinch had a shrewd notion that Salisbury was a very desperate sort of place; an exceeding wild and dissipated city; and when he had put up the horse, and given the hostler to understand that he would look in again in the course of an hour or two to see him take his corn, he set forth on a stroll about the streets with a vague and not unpleasant idea that they teemed with all kinds of mystery and bedevilment.</s> <s sid="147" id="MC.c5.s147">To one of his quiet habits this little delusion was greatly assisted by the circumstance of its being market-day, and the thoroughfares about the market-place being filled with carts, horses, donkeys, baskets, waggons, garden-stuff, meat, tripe, pies, poultry and huckster's wares of every opposite description and possible variety of character.</s> <s sid="148" id="MC.c5.s148">Then there were young farmers and old farmers with smock-frocks, brown great-coats, drab great-coats, red worsted comforters, leather-leggings, wonderful shaped hats, hunting-whips, and rough sticks, standing about in groups, or talking noisily together on the tavern steps, or paying and receiving huge amounts of greasy wealth, with the assistance of such bulky pocket-books that when they were in their pockets it was apoplexy to get them out, and when they were out it was spasms to get them in again.</s> <s sid="149" id="MC.c5.s149">Also there were farmers' wives in beaver bonnets and red cloaks, riding shaggy horses purged of all earthly passions, who went soberly into all manner of places without desiring to know why, and who, if required, would have stood stock still in a china shop, with a complete dinner-service at each hoof.</s> <s sid="150" id="MC.c5.s150">Also a great many dogs, who were strongly interested in the state of the market and the bargains of their masters; and a great confusion of tongues, both brute and human.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER SIX COMPRISES, AMONG OTHER IMPORTANT MATTERS, PECKSNIFFIAN AND ARCHITECTURAL, AND EXACT RELATION OF THE PROGRESS MADE BY MR PINCH IN THE CONFIDENCE AND FRIENDSHIP OF THE NEW PUPIL</title>

<p pid="1" id="MC.c6.p1"><s sid="1" id="MC.c6.s1">It was morning; and the beautiful Aurora, of whom so much hath been written, said, and sung, did, with her rosy fingers, nip and tweak Miss Pecksniff's nose.</s> <s sid="2" id="MC.c6.s2">It was the frolicsome custom of the Goddess, in her intercourse with the fair Cherry, so to do; or in more prosaic phrase, the tip of that feature in the sweet girl's countenance was always very red at breakfast-time.</s> <s sid="3" id="MC.c6.s3">For the most part, indeed, it wore, at that season of the day, a scraped and frosty look, as if it had been rasped; while a similar phenomenon developed itself in her humour, which was then observed to be of a sharp and acid quality, as though an extra lemon (figuratively speaking) had been squeezed into the nectar of her disposition, and had rather damaged its flavour.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c6.p2"><s sid="4" id="MC.c6.s4">This additional pungency on the part of the fair young creature led, on ordinary occasions, to such slight consequences as the copious dilution of Mr Pinch's tea, or to his coming off uncommonly short in respect of butter, or to other the like results.</s> <s sid="5" id="MC.c6.s5">But on the morning after the Installation Banquet, she suffered him to wander to and fro among the eatables and drinkables, a perfectly free and unchecked man; so utterly to Mr Pinch's wonder and confusion, that like the wretched captive who recovered his liberty in his old age, he could make but little use of his enlargement, and fell into a strange kind of flutter for want of some kind hand to scrape his bread, and cut him off in the article of sugar with a lump, and pay him those other little attentions to which he was accustomed.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c6.s6">There was something almost awful, too, about the self-possession of the new pupil; who 'troubled' Mr Pecksniff for the loaf, and helped himself to a rasher of that gentleman's own particular and private bacon, with all the coolness in life.</s> <s sid="7" id="MC.c6.s7">He even seemed to think that he was doing quite a regular thing, and to expect that Mr Pinch would follow his example, since he took occasion to observe of that young man 'that he didn't get on'; a speech of so tremendous a character, that Tom cast down his eyes involuntarily, and felt as if he himself had committed some horrible deed and heinous breach of Mr Pecksniff's confidence.</s> <s sid="8" id="MC.c6.s8">Indeed, the agony of having such an indiscreet remark addressed to him before the assembled family, was breakfast enough in itself, and would, without any other matter of reflection, have settled Mr Pinch's business and quenched his appetite, for one meal, though he had been never so hungry.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c6.p3"><s sid="9" id="MC.c6.s9">The young ladies, however, and Mr Pecksniff likewise, remained in the very best of spirits in spite of these severe trials, though with something of a mysterious understanding among themselves.</s> <s sid="10" id="MC.c6.s10">When the meal was nearly over, Mr Pecksniff smilingly explained the cause of their common satisfaction.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="MC.c6.p11" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="MC.c6.s28"><qs/>'You will take care, my dear Martin,'<qe/><sls/> said Mr Pecksniff, resuming his former cheerfulness, <sle/><qs/>'that the house does not run away in our absence.</s> <s sid="29" id="MC.c6.s29">We leave you in charge of everything.</s> <s sid="30" id="MC.c6.s30">There is no mystery; all is free and open.</s> <s sid="31" id="MC.c6.s31">Unlike the young man in the Eastern tale--who is described as a one-eyed almanac, if I am not mistaken, Mr Pinch?--'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="12" id="MC.c6.p12" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="MC.c6.s32"><qs/>'A one-eyed calender, I think, sir,'<qe/> faltered Tom.</s> </p><p pid="13" id="MC.c6.p13" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="MC.c6.s33"><qs/>'They are pretty nearly the same thing, I believe,'<qe/><sls/> said Mr Pecksniff, smiling compassionately; <sle/><qs/>'or they used to be in my time.</s> <s sid="34" id="MC.c6.s34">Unlike that young man, my dear Martin, you are forbidden to enter no corner of this house; but are requested to make yourself perfectly at home in every part of it.</s> <s sid="35" id="MC.c6.s35">You will be jovial, my dear Martin, and will kill the fatted calf if you please!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="MC.c6.p14"><s sid="36" id="MC.c6.s36">There was not the least objection, doubtless, to the young man's slaughtering and appropriating to his own use any calf, fat or lean, that he might happen to find upon the premises; but as no such animal chanced at that time to be grazing on Mr Pecksniff's estate, this request must be considered rather as a polite compliment that a substantial hospitality.</s> <s sid="37" id="MC.c6.s37">It was the finishing ornament of the conversation; for when he had delivered it, Mr Pecksniff rose and led the way to that hotbed of architectural genius, the two-pair front.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="MC.c6.p15" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="MC.c6.s38"><qs/>'Let me see,'<qe/><sls/> he said, searching among the papers, <sle/><qs/>'how you can best employ yourself, Martin, while I am absent.</s> <s sid="39" id="MC.c6.s39">Suppose you were to give me your idea of a monument to a Lord Mayor of London; or a tomb for a sheriff; or your notion of a cow-house to be erected in a nobleman's park.</s> <s sid="40" id="MC.c6.s40">Do you know, now,'<qe/><sls/> said Mr Pecksniff, folding his hands, and looking at his young relation with an air of pensive interest, <sle/><qs/>'that I should very much like to see your notion of a cow-house?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="16" id="MC.c6.p16"><s sid="41" id="MC.c6.s41">But Martin by no means appeared to relish this suggestion.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="MC.c6.p23"><s sid="64" id="MC.c6.s64">He would not have had leisure to say much, had his new friend been ever so loquacious; for first of all Mr Pecksniff called him down to stand upon the top of his portmanteau and represent ancient statues there, until such time as it would consent to be locked; and then Miss Charity called him to come and cord her trunk; and then Miss Mercy sent for him to come and mend her box; and then he wrote the fullest possible cards for all the luggage; and then he volunteered to carry it all downstairs; and after that to see it safely carried on a couple of barrows to the old finger-post at the end of the lane; and then to mind it till the coach came up.</s> <s sid="65" id="MC.c6.s65">In short, his day's work would have been a pretty heavy one for a porter, but his thorough good-will made nothing of it; and as he sat upon the luggage at last, waiting for the Pecksniffs, escorted by the new pupil, to come down the lane, his heart was light with the hope of having pleased his benefactor.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c8.p3" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="MC.c8.s9"><qs/>'What are we?'<qe/><sss/> said Mr Pecksniff, <sse/><qs/>'but coaches?</s> <s sid="10" id="MC.c8.s10">Some of us are slow coaches'<qe/>--</s> </p><p pid="4" id="MC.c8.p4" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="MC.c8.s11"><qs/>'Goodness, Pa!'<qe/> cried Charity.</s> </p><p pid="5" id="MC.c8.p5" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="MC.c8.s12"><qs/>'Some of us, I say,'<qe/><sls/> resumed her parent with increased emphasis, <sle/><qs/>'are slow coaches; some of us are fast coaches.</s> <s sid="13" id="MC.c8.s13">Our passions are the horses; and rampant animals too--!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="MC.c8.p6" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="MC.c8.s14"><qs/>'Really, Pa,'<qe/> cried both the daughters at once.</s> <s sid="15" id="MC.c8.s15"><qs/>'How very unpleasant.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="7" id="MC.c8.p7" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="MC.c8.s16"><qs/>'And rampant animals too' repeated Mr Pecksniff with so much determination, that he may be said to have exhibited, at the moment a sort of moral rampancy himself;'<qe/>--and Virtue is the drag.</s> <s sid="17" id="MC.c8.s17">We start from The Mother's Arms, and we run to The Dust Shovel.'</s> </p><p pid="8" id="MC.c8.p8"><s sid="18" id="MC.c8.s18">When he had said this, Mr Pecksniff, being exhausted, took some further refreshment.</s> <s sid="19" id="MC.c8.s19">When he had done that, he corked the bottle tight, with the air of a man who had effectually corked the subject also; and went to sleep for three stages.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="MC.c8.p9"><s sid="20" id="MC.c8.s20">The tendency of mankind when it falls asleep in coaches, is to wake up cross; to find its legs in its way; and its corns an aggravation.</s> <s sid="21" id="MC.c8.s21">Mr Pecksniff not being exempt from the common lot of humanity found himself, at the end of his nap, so decidedly the victim of these infirmities, that he had an irresistible inclination to visit them upon his daughters; which he had already begun to do in the shape of divers random kicks, and other unexpected motions of his shoes, when the coach stopped, and after a short delay the door was opened.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="MC.c8.p44" type="speech"><s sid="103" id="MC.c8.s103"><qs/>'Come, wake up, father, or you'll be having the nightmare, and screeching out, I know.--Do you ever have the nightmare, cousin?'<qe/> he asked his neighbour, with characteristic gallantry, as he dropped his voice again.</s> </p><p pid="45" id="MC.c8.p45" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="MC.c8.s104"><qs/>'Sometimes,'<qe/> answered Charity.</s> <s sid="105" id="MC.c8.s105"><qs/>'Not often.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="46" id="MC.c8.p46" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="MC.c8.s106"><qs/>'The other one,'<qe/> said Mr Jonas, after a pause.</s> <s sid="107" id="MC.c8.s107"><qs/>'Does SHE ever have the nightmare?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="47" id="MC.c8.p47" type="speech"><s sid="108" id="MC.c8.s108"><qs/>'I don't know,'<qe/> replied Charity.</s> <s sid="109" id="MC.c8.s109"><qs/>'You had better ask her.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="48" id="MC.c8.p48" type="speech"><s sid="110" id="MC.c8.s110"><qs/>'She laughs so,'<qe/><sss/> said Jonas; <sse/><qs/>'there's no talking to her.</s> <s sid="111" id="MC.c8.s111">Only hark how she's a-going on now!</s> <s sid="112" id="MC.c8.s112">You're the sensible one, cousin!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="49" id="MC.c8.p49" type="speech"><s sid="113" id="MC.c8.s113"><qs/>'Tut, tut!'<qe/> cried Charity.</s> </p><p pid="50" id="MC.c8.p50" type="speech"><s sid="114" id="MC.c8.s114"><qs/>'Oh!</s> <s sid="115" id="MC.c8.s115">But you are!</s> <s sid="116" id="MC.c8.s116">You know you are!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="51" id="MC.c8.p51" type="speech"><s sid="117" id="MC.c8.s117"><qs/>'Mercy is a little giddy,'<qe/> said Miss Charity.</s> <s sid="118" id="MC.c8.s118">But she'll sober down in time.'</s> </p><p pid="52" id="MC.c8.p52" type="speech"><s sid="119" id="MC.c8.s119"><qs/>'It'll be a very long time, then, if she does at all,'<qe/> rejoined her cousin.</s> <s sid="120" id="MC.c8.s120"><qs/>'Take a little more room.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="53" id="MC.c8.p53" type="speech"><s sid="121" id="MC.c8.s121"><qs/>'I am afraid of crowding you,'<qe/> said Charity.</s> <s sid="122" id="MC.c8.s122">But she took it notwithstanding; and after one or two remarks on the extreme heaviness of the coach, and the number of places it stopped at, they fell into a silence which remained unbroken by any member of the party until supper-time.</s> </p><p pid="54" id="MC.c8.p54"><s sid="123" id="MC.c8.s123">Although Mr Jonas conducted Charity to the hotel and sat himself beside her at the board, it was pretty clear that he had an eye to 'the other one' also, for he often glanced across at Mercy, and seemed to draw comparisons between the personal appearance of the two, which were not unfavourable to the superior plumpness of the younger sister.</s> <s sid="124" id="MC.c8.s124">He allowed himself no great leisure for this kind of observation, however, being busily engaged with the supper, which, as he whispered in his fair companion's ear, was a contract business, and therefore the more she ate, the better the bargain was.</s> <s sid="125" id="MC.c8.s125">His father and Mr Pecksniff, probably acting on the same wise principle, demolished everything that came within their reach, and by that means acquired a greasy expression of countenance, indicating contentment, if not repletion, which it was very pleasant to contemplate.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="MC.c8.p55"><s sid="126" id="MC.c8.s126">When they could eat no more, Mr Pecksniff and Mr Jonas subscribed for two sixpenny-worths of hot brandy-and-water, which the latter gentleman considered a more politic order than one shillingsworth; there being a chance of their getting more spirit out of the innkeeper under this arrangement than if it were all in one glass.</s> <s sid="127" id="MC.c8.s127">Having swallowed his share of the enlivening fluid, Mr Pecksniff, under pretence of going to see if the coach were ready, went secretly to the bar, and had his own little bottle filled, in order that he might refresh himself at leisure in the dark coach without being observed.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="MC.c8.p56"><s sid="128" id="MC.c8.s128">These arrangements concluded, and the coach being ready, they got into their old places and jogged on again.</s> <s sid="129" id="MC.c8.s129">But before he composed himself for a nap, Mr Pecksniff delivered a kind of grace after meat, in these words:</s> </p>

<p pid="57" id="MC.c8.p57" type="speech"><s sid="130" id="MC.c8.s130"><qs/>'The process of digestion, as I have been informed by anatomical friends, is one of the most wonderful works of nature.</s> <s sid="131" id="MC.c8.s131">I do not know how it may be with others, but it is a great satisfaction to me to know, when regaling on my humble fare, that I am putting in motion the most beautiful machinery with which we have any acquaintance.</s> <s sid="132" id="MC.c8.s132">I really feel at such times as if I was doing a public service.</s> <s sid="133" id="MC.c8.s133">When I have wound myself up, if I may employ such a term,'<qe/><sls/> said Mr Pecksniff with exquisite tenderness, <sle/><qs/>'and know that I am Going, I feel that in the lesson afforded by the works within me, I am a Benefactor to my Kind!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="58" id="MC.c8.p58"><s sid="134" id="MC.c8.s134">As nothing could be added to this, nothing was said; and Mr Pecksniff, exulting, it may be presumed, in his moral utility, went to sleep again.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="MC.c8.p60"><s sid="140" id="MC.c8.s140">Very soon afterwards the coach stopped at the office in the city; and the street in which it was situated was already in a bustle, that fully bore out Mr Pecksniff's words about its being morning, though for any signs of day yet appearing in the sky it might have been midnight.</s> <s sid="141" id="MC.c8.s141">There was a dense fog too; as if it were a city in the clouds, which they had been travelling to all night up a magic beanstalk; and there was a thick crust upon the pavement like oilcake; which, one of the outsides (mad, no doubt) said to another (his keeper, of course), was Snow.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="MC.c8.p61"><s sid="142" id="MC.c8.s142">Taking a confused leave of Anthony and his son, and leaving the luggage of himself and daughters at the office to be called for afterwards, Mr Pecksniff, with one of the young ladies under each arm, dived across the street, and then across other streets, and so up the queerest courts, and down the strangest alleys and under the blindest archways, in a kind of frenzy; now skipping over a kennel, now running for his life from a coach and horses; now thinking he had lost his way, now thinking he had found it; now in a state of the highest confidence, now despondent to the last degree, but always in a great perspiration and flurry; until at length they stopped in a kind of paved yard near the Monument.</s> <s sid="143" id="MC.c8.s143">That is to say, Mr Pecksniff told them so; for as to anything they could see of the Monument, or anything else but the buildings close at hand, they might as well have been playing blindman's buff at Salisbury.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="MC.c8.p62" type="speech"><s sid="144" id="MC.c8.s144">Mr Pecksniff looked about him for a moment, and then knocked at the door of a very dingy edifice, even among the choice collection of dingy edifices at hand; on the front of which was a little oval board like a tea-tray, with this inscription--<qs/>'Commercial Boarding- House:</s> <s sid="145" id="MC.c8.s145">M.

<p pid="2" id="MC.c9.p2"><s sid="3" id="MC.c9.s3">You couldn't walk about Todgers's neighbourhood, as you could in any other neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="4" id="MC.c9.s4">You groped your way for an hour through lanes and byways, and court-yards, and passages; and you never once emerged upon anything that might be reasonably called a street.</s> <s sid="5" id="MC.c9.s5">A kind of resigned distraction came over the stranger as he trod those devious mazes, and, giving himself up for lost, went in and out and round about and quietly turned back again when he came to a dead wall or was stopped by an iron railing, and felt that the means of escape might possibly present themselves in their own good time, but that to anticipate them was hopeless.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c9.s6">Instances were known of people who, being asked to dine at Todgers's, had travelled round and round for a weary time, with its very chimney-pots in view; and finding it, at last, impossible of attainment, had gone home again with a gentle melancholy on their spirits, tranquil and uncomplaining.</s> <s sid="7" id="MC.c9.s7">Nobody had ever found Todgers's on a verbal direction, though given within a few minutes' walk of it.</s> <s sid="8" id="MC.c9.s8">Cautious emigrants from Scotland or the North of England had been known to reach it safely, by impressing a charity-boy, town-bred, and bringing him along with them; or by clinging tenaciously to the postman; but these were rare exceptions, and only went to prove the rule that Todgers's was in a labyrinth, whereof the mystery was known but to a chosen few.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c9.p3"><s sid="9" id="MC.c9.s9">Several fruit-brokers had their marts near Todgers's; and one of the first impressions wrought upon the stranger's senses was of oranges --of damaged oranges--with blue and green bruises on them, festering in boxes, or mouldering away in cellars.</s> <s sid="10" id="MC.c9.s10">All day long, a stream of porters from the wharves beside the river, each bearing on his back a bursting chest of oranges, poured slowly through the narrow passages; while underneath the archway by the public-house, the knots of those who rested and regaled within, were piled from morning until night.</s> <s sid="11" id="MC.c9.s11">Strange solitary pumps were found near Todgers's hiding themselves for the most part in blind alleys, and keeping company with fire-ladders.</s> <s sid="12" id="MC.c9.s12">There were churches also by dozens, with many a ghostly little churchyard, all overgrown with such straggling vegetation as springs up spontaneously from damp, and graves, and rubbish.</s> <s sid="13" id="MC.c9.s13">In some of these dingy resting-places which bore much the same analogy to green churchyards, as the pots of earth for mignonette and wall-flower in the windows overlooking them did to rustic gardens, there were trees; tall trees; still putting forth their leaves in each succeeding year, with such a languishing remembrance of their kind (so one might fancy, looking on their sickly boughs) as birds in cages have of theirs.</s> <s sid="14" id="MC.c9.s14">Here, paralysed old watchmen guarded the bodies of the dead at night, year after year, until at last they joined that solemn brotherhood; and, saving that they slept below the ground a sounder sleep than even they had ever known above it, and were shut up in another kind of box, their condition can hardly be said to have undergone any material change when they, in turn, were watched themselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="MC.c9.p4"><s sid="15" id="MC.c9.s15">Among the narrow thoroughfares at hand, there lingered, here and there, an ancient doorway of carved oak, from which, of old, the sounds of revelry and feasting often came; but now these mansions, only used for storehouses, were dark and dull, and, being filled with wool, and cotton, and the like--such heavy merchandise as stifles sound and stops the throat of echo--had an air of palpable deadness about them which, added to their silence and desertion, made them very grim.</s> <s sid="16" id="MC.c9.s16">In like manner, there were gloomy courtyards in these parts, into which few but belated wayfarers ever strayed, and where vast bags and packs of goods, upward or downward bound, were for ever dangling between heaven and earth from lofty cranes There were more trucks near Todgers's than you would suppose whole city could ever need; not active trucks, but a vagabond race, for ever lounging in the narrow lanes before their masters' doors and stopping up the pass; so that when a stray hackney-coach or lumbering waggon came that way, they were the cause of such an uproar as enlivened the whole neighbourhood, and made the bells in the next churchtower vibrate again.</s> <s sid="17" id="MC.c9.s17">In the throats and maws of dark no-thoroughfares near Todgers's, individual wine-merchants and wholesale dealers in grocery-ware had perfect little towns of their own; and, deep among the foundations of these buildings, the ground was undermined and burrowed out into stables, where cart-horses, troubled by rats, might be heard on a quiet Sunday rattling their halters, as disturbed spirits in tales of haunted houses are said to clank their chains.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="MC.c9.p5"><s sid="18" id="MC.c9.s18">To tell of half the queer old taverns that had a drowsy and secret existence near Todgers's, would fill a goodly book; while a second volume no less capacious might be devoted to an account of the quaint old guests who frequented their dimly lighted parlours.</s> <s sid="19" id="MC.c9.s19">These were, in general, ancient inhabitants of that region; born, and bred there from boyhood.  who had long since become wheezy and asthmatical, and short of breath, except in the article of story- telling; in which respect they were still marvellously long-winded.</s> <s sid="20" id="MC.c9.s20">These gentry were much opposed to steam and all new-fangled ways, and held ballooning to be sinful, and deplored the degeneracy of the times; which that particular member of each little club who kept the keys of the nearest church, professionally, always attributed to the prevalence of dissent and irreligion; though the major part of the company inclined to the belief that virtue went out with hair- powder, and that Old England's greatness had decayed amain with barbers.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="MC.c9.p7"><s sid="24" id="MC.c9.s24">The top of the house was worthy of notice.</s> <s sid="25" id="MC.c9.s25">There was a sort of terrace on the roof, with posts and fragments of rotten lines, once intended to dry clothes upon; and there were two or three tea-chests out there, full of earth, with forgotten plants in them, like old walking-sticks.</s> <s sid="26" id="MC.c9.s26">Whoever climbed to this observatory, was stunned at first from having knocked his head against the little door in coming out; and after that, was for the moment choked from having looked perforce, straight down the kitchen chimney; but these two stages over, there were things to gaze at from the top of Todgers's, well worth your seeing too.</s> <s sid="27" id="MC.c9.s27">For first and foremost, if the day were bright, you observed upon the house-tops, stretching far away, a long dark path; the shadow of the Monument; and turning round, the tall original was close beside you, with every hair erect upon his golden head, as if the doings of the city frightened him.</s> <s sid="28" id="MC.c9.s28">Then there were steeples, towers, belfries, shining vanes, and masts of ships; a very forest.</s> <s sid="29" id="MC.c9.s29">Gables, housetops, garret-windows, wilderness upon wilderness.</s> <s sid="30" id="MC.c9.s30">Smoke and noise enough for all the world at once.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="MC.c11.p9" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="MC.c11.s22"><qs/>'Quite impossible to divine!'<qe/><sls/> said Charity, with some sharpness, <sle/><qs/>'though still, at the same time, you needn't be angry, my dear.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="10" id="MC.c11.p10" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="MC.c11.s23"><qs/>'Thank you,'<qe/> retorted Merry, singing at her needle.</s> <s sid="24" id="MC.c11.s24"><qs/>'I am quite aware of that, my love.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="MC.c11.p11" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="MC.c11.s25"><qs/>'I am afraid your head is turned, you silly thing,'<qe/> said Cherry.</s> </p><p pid="12" id="MC.c11.p12" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="MC.c11.s26"><qs/>'Do you know, my dear,'<qe/><sls/> said Merry, with engaging candour, <sle/><qs/>'that I have been afraid of that, myself, all along!</s> <s sid="27" id="MC.c11.s27">So much incense and nonsense, and all the rest of it, is enough to turn a stronger head than mine.</s> <s sid="28" id="MC.c11.s28">What a relief it must be to you, my dear, to be so very comfortable in that respect, and not to be worried by those odious men!</s> <s sid="29" id="MC.c11.s29">How do you do it, Cherry?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="MC.c11.p13" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="MC.c11.s30">This artless inquiry might have led to turbulent results, but for the strong emotions of delight evinced by Bailey junior, whose relish in the turn the conversation had lately taken was so acute, that it impelled and forced him to the instantaneous performance of a dancing step, extremely difficult in its nature, and only to be achieved in a moment of ecstasy, which is commonly called The Frog's Hornpipe.</s> <s sid="31" id="MC.c11.s31">A manifestation so lively, brought to their immediate recollection the great virtuous precept, <qs/>'Keep up appearances whatever you do,'<qe/> in which they had been educated.</s> <s sid="32" id="MC.c11.s32">They forbore at once, and jointly signified to Mr Bailey that if he should presume to practice that figure any more in their presence, they would instantly acquaint Mrs Todgers with the fact, and would demand his condign punishment, at the hands of that lady.</s> <s sid="33" id="MC.c11.s33">The young gentleman having expressed the bitterness of his contrition by affecting to wipe away scalding tears with his apron, and afterwards feigning to wring a vast amount of water from that garment, held the door open while Miss Charity passed out; and so that damsel went in state upstairs to receive her mysterious adorer.</s> </p><p pid="14" id="MC.c11.p14"><s sid="34" id="MC.c11.s34">By some strange occurrence of favourable circumstances he had found out the drawing-room, and was sitting there alone.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="MC.c11.p51" type="speech"><s sid="117" id="MC.c11.s117">Mr Jonas inquired in the first instance if they were good walkers and being answered, <qs/>'Yes,'<qe/> submitted their pedestrian powers to a pretty severe test; for he showed them as many sights, in the way of bridges, churches, streets, outsides of theatres, and other free spectacles, in that one forenoon, as most people see in a twelvemonth.</s> <s sid="118" id="MC.c11.s118">It was observable in this gentleman, that he had an insurmountable distaste to the insides of buildings, and that he was perfectly acquainted with the merits of all shows, in respect of which there was any charge for admission, which it seemed were every one detestable, and of the very lowest grade of merit.</s> <s sid="119" id="MC.c11.s119">He was so thoroughly possessed with this opinion, that when Miss Charity happened to mention the circumstance of their having been twice or thrice to the theatre with Mr Jinkins and party, he inquired, as a matter of course, <qs/>'where the orders came from?'<qe/><sls/> and being told that Mr Jinkins and party paid, was beyond description entertained, observing that <sle/><qs/>'they must be nice flats, certainly;'<qe/> and often in the course of the walk, bursting out again into a perfect convulsion of laughter at the surpassing silliness of those gentlemen, and (doubtless) at his own superior wisdom.</s> </p><p pid="52" id="MC.c11.p52"><s sid="120" id="MC.c11.s120">When they had been out for some hours and were thoroughly fatigued, it being by that time twilight, Mr Jonas intimated that he would show them one of the best pieces of fun with which he was acquainted.</s> <s sid="121" id="MC.c11.s121">This joke was of a practical kind, and its humour lay in taking a hackney-coach to the extreme limits of possibility for a shilling.</s> <s sid="122" id="MC.c11.s122">Happily it brought them to the place where Mr Jonas dwelt, or the young ladies might have rather missed the point and cream of the jest.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="MC.c11.p53"><s sid="123" id="MC.c11.s123">The old-established firm of Anthony Chuzzlewit and Son, Manchester Warehousemen, and so forth, had its place of business in a very narrow street somewhere behind the Post Office; where every house was in the brightest summer morning very gloomy; and where light porters watered the pavement, each before his own employer's premises, in fantastic patterns, in the dog-days; and where spruce gentlemen with their hands in the pockets of symmetrical trousers, were always to be seen in warm weather, contemplating their undeniable boots in dusty warehouse doorways; which appeared to be the hardest work they did, except now and then carrying pens behind their ears.</s> <s sid="124" id="MC.c11.s124">A dim, dirty, smoky, tumble-down, rotten old house it was, as anybody would desire to see; but there the firm of Anthony Chuzzlewit and Son transacted all their business and their pleasure too, such as it was; for neither the young man nor the old had any other residence, or any care or thought beyond its narrow limits.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER THIRTEEN SHOWING WHAT BECAME OF MARTIN AND HIS DESPARATE RESOLVE, AFTER HE LEFT MR PECKSNIFF'S HOUSE; WHAT PERSONS HE ENCOUNTERED; WHAT ANXIETIES HE SUFFERED; AND WHAT NEWS HE HEARD</title>

<p pid="1" id="MC.c13.p1"><s sid="1" id="MC.c13.s1">Carrying Tom Pinch's book quite unconsciously under his arm, and not even buttoning his coat as a protection against the heavy rain, Martin went doggedly forward at the same quick pace, until he had passed the finger-post, and was on the high road to London.</s> <s sid="2" id="MC.c13.s2">He slackened very little in his speed even then, but he began to think, and look about him, and to disengage his senses from the coil of angry passions which hitherto had held them prisoner.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c13.p2"><s sid="3" id="MC.c13.s3">It must be confessed that, at that moment, he had no very agreeable employment either for his moral or his physical perceptions.</s> <s sid="4" id="MC.c13.s4">The day was dawning from a patch of watery light in the east, and sullen clouds came driving up before it, from which the rain descended in a thick, wet mist.</s> <s sid="5" id="MC.c13.s5">It streamed from every twig and bramble in the hedge; made little gullies in the path; ran down a hundred channels in the road; and punched innumerable holes into the face of every pond and gutter.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c13.s6">It fell with an oozy, slushy sound among the grass; and made a muddy kennel of every furrow in the ploughed fields.</s> <s sid="7" id="MC.c13.s7">No living creature was anywhere to be seen.</s> <s sid="8" id="MC.c13.s8">The prospect could hardly have been more desolate if animated nature had been dissolved in water, and poured down upon the earth again in that form.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c13.p3"><s sid="9" id="MC.c13.s9">The range of view within the solitary traveller was quite as cheerless as the scene without.</s> <s sid="10" id="MC.c13.s10">Friendless and penniless; incensed to the last degree; deeply wounded in his pride and self-love; full of independent schemes, and perfectly destitute of any means of realizing them; his most vindictive enemy might have been satisfied with the extent of his troubles.</s> <s sid="11" id="MC.c13.s11">To add to his other miseries, he was by this time sensible of being wet to the skin, and cold at his very heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="MC.c13.p4" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="MC.c13.s12">In this deplorable condition he remembered Mr Pinch's book; more because it was rather troublesome to carry, than from any hope of being comforted by that parting gift.</s> <s sid="13" id="MC.c13.s13">He looked at the dingy lettering on the back, and finding it to be an odd volume of the <qs/>'Bachelor of Salamanca,'<qe/> in the French tongue, cursed Tom Pinch's folly twenty times.</s> <s sid="14" id="MC.c13.s14">He was on the point of throwing it away, in his ill-humour and vexation, when he bethought himself that Tom had referred him to a leaf, turned down; and opening it at that place, that he might have additional cause of complaint against him for supposing that any cold scrap of the Bachelor's wisdom could cheer him in such circumstances, found!--</s> </p><p pid="5" id="MC.c13.p5" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="MC.c13.s15">Well, well! not much, but Tom's all.</s> <s sid="16" id="MC.c13.s16">The half-sovereign.</s> <s sid="17" id="MC.c13.s17">He had wrapped it hastily in a piece of paper, and pinned it to the leaf.</s> <s sid="18" id="MC.c13.s18">These words were scrawled in pencil on the inside:</s> <s sid="19" id="MC.c13.s19"><qs/>'I don't want it indeed.</s> <s sid="20" id="MC.c13.s20">I should not know what to do with it if I had it.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="MC.c13.p6"><s sid="21" id="MC.c13.s21">There are some falsehoods, Tom, on which men mount, as on bright wings, towards Heaven.</s> <s sid="22" id="MC.c13.s22">There are some truths, cold bitter taunting truths, wherein your worldly scholars are very apt and punctual, which bind men down to earth with leaden chains.</s> <s sid="23" id="MC.c13.s23">Who would not rather have to fan him, in his dying hour, the lightest feather of a falsehood such as thine, than all the quills that have been plucked from the sharp porcupine, reproachful truth, since time began!</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="MC.c13.p7"><s sid="24" id="MC.c13.s24">Martin felt keenly for himself, and he felt this good deed of Tom's keenly.</s> <s sid="25" id="MC.c13.s25">After a few minutes it had the effect of raising his spirits, and reminding him that he was not altogether destitute, as he had left a fair stock of clothes behind him, and wore a gold hunting-watch in his pocket.</s> <s sid="26" id="MC.c13.s26">He found a curious gratification, too, in thinking what a winning fellow he must be to have made such an impression on Tom; and in reflecting how superior he was to Tom; and how much more likely to make his way in the world.</s> <s sid="27" id="MC.c13.s27">Animated by these thoughts, and strengthened in his design of endeavouring to push his fortune in another country, he resolved to get to London as a rallying-point, in the best way he could; and to lose no time about it.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="MC.c13.p8" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="MC.c13.s28">He was ten good miles from the village made illustrious by being the abiding-place of Mr Pecksniff, when he stopped to breakfast at a little roadside alehouse; and resting upon a high-backed settle before the fire, pulled off his coat, and hung it before the cheerful blaze to dry.</s> <s sid="29" id="MC.c13.s29">It was a very different place from the last tavern in which he had regaled; boasting no greater extent of accommodation than the brick-floored kitchen yielded; but the mind so soon accommodates itself to the necessities of the body, that this poor waggoner's house-of-call, which he would have despised yesterday, became now quite a choice hotel; while his dish of eggs and bacon, and his mug of beer, were not by any means the coarse fare he had supposed, but fully bore out the inscription on the window-shutter, which proclaimed those viands to be <qs/>'Good entertainment for Travellers.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="9" id="MC.c13.p9"><s sid="30" id="MC.c13.s30">He pushed away his empty plate; and with a second mug upon the hearth before him, looked thoughtfully at the fire until his eyes ached.</s> <s sid="31" id="MC.c13.s31">Then he looked at the highly-coloured scripture pieces on the walls, in little black frames like common shaving-glasses, and saw how the Wise Men (with a strong family likeness among them) worshipped in a pink manger; and how the Prodigal Son came home in red rags to a purple father, and already feasted his imagination on a sea-green calf.</s> <s sid="32" id="MC.c13.s32">Then he glanced through the window at the falling rain, coming down aslant upon the sign-post over against the house, and overflowing the horse-trough; and then he looked at the fire again, and seemed to descry a double distant London, retreating among the fragments of the burning wood.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="MC.c13.p10"><s sid="33" id="MC.c13.s33">He had repeated this process in just the same order, many times, as if it were a matter of necessity, when the sound of wheels called his attention to the window out of its regular turn; and there he beheld a kind of light van drawn by four horses, and laden, as well as he could see (for it was covered in), with corn and straw.</s> <s sid="34" id="MC.c13.s34">The driver, who was alone, stopped at the door to water his team, and presently came stamping and shaking the wet off his hat and coat, into the room where Martin sat.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="MC.c13.p11"><s sid="35" id="MC.c13.s35">He was a red-faced burly young fellow; smart in his way, and with a good-humoured countenance.</s> <s sid="36" id="MC.c13.s36">As he advanced towards the fire he touched his shining forehead with the forefinger of his stiff leather glove, by way of salutation; and said (rather unnecessarily) that it was an uncommon wet day.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c19.p3" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="MC.c19.s8">This lady lodged at a bird-fancier's, next door but one to the celebrated mutton-pie shop, and directly opposite to the original cat's-meat warehouse; the renown of which establishments was duly heralded on their respective fronts.</s> <s sid="9" id="MC.c19.s9">It was a little house, and this was the more convenient; for Mrs Gamp being, in her highest walk of art, a monthly nurse, or, as her sign-board boldly had it, <qs/>'Midwife,'<qe/> and lodging in the first-floor front, was easily assailable at night by pebbles, walking-sticks, and fragments of tobacco-pipe; all much more efficacious than the street-door knocker, which was so constructed as to wake the street with ease, and even spread alarms of fire in Holborn, without making the smallest impression on the premises to which it was addressed.</s> </p><p pid="4" id="MC.c19.p4"><s sid="10" id="MC.c19.s10">It chanced on this particular occasion, that Mrs Gamp had been up all the previous night, in attendance upon a ceremony to which the usage of gossips has given that name which expresses, in two syllables, the curse pronounced on Adam.</s> <s sid="11" id="MC.c19.s11">It chanced that Mrs Gamp had not been regularly engaged, but had been called in at a crisis, in consequence of her great repute, to assist another professional lady with her advice; and thus it happened that, all points of interest in the case being over, Mrs Gamp had come home again to the bird-fancier's and gone to bed.</s> <s sid="12" id="MC.c19.s12">So when Mr Pecksniff drove up in the hackney cab, Mrs Gamp's curtains were drawn close, and Mrs Gamp was fast asleep behind them.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="MC.c19.p5"><s sid="13" id="MC.c19.s13">If the bird-fancier had been at home, as he ought to have been, there would have been no great harm in this; but he was out, and his shop was closed.</s> <s sid="14" id="MC.c19.s14">The shutters were down certainly; and in every pane of glass there was at least one tiny bird in a tiny bird-cage, twittering and hopping his little ballet of despair, and knocking his head against the roof; while one unhappy goldfinch who lived outside a red villa with his name on the door, drew the water for his own drinking, and mutely appealed to some good man to drop a farthing's-worth of poison in it.</s> <s sid="15" id="MC.c19.s15">Still, the door was shut.</s> <s sid="16" id="MC.c19.s16">Mr Pecksniff tried the latch, and shook it, causing a cracked bell inside to ring most mournfully; but no one came.</s> <s sid="17" id="MC.c19.s17">The bird-fancier was an easy shaver also, and a fashionable hair-dresser also, and perhaps he had been sent for, express, from the court end of the town, to trim a lord, or cut and curl a lady; but however that might be, there, upon his own ground, he was not; nor was there any more distinct trace of him to assist the imagination of an inquirer, than a professional print or emblem of his calling (much favoured in the trade), representing a hair-dresser of easy manners curling a lady of distinguished fashion, in the presence of a patent upright grand pianoforte.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="MC.c19.p6" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="MC.c19.s18">Noting these circumstances, Mr Pecksniff, in the innocence of his heart, applied himself to the knocker; but at the first double knock every window in the street became alive with female heads; and before he could repeat the performance whole troops of married ladies (some about to trouble Mrs Gamp themselves very shortly) came flocking round the steps, all crying out with one accord, and with uncommon interest, <qs/>'Knock at the winder, sir, knock at the winder.</s> <s sid="19" id="MC.c19.s19">Lord bless you, don't lose no more time than you can help--knock at the winder!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="7" id="MC.c19.p7" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="MC.c19.s20">Acting upon this suggestion, and borrowing the driver's whip for the purpose, Mr Pecksniff soon made a commotion among the first floor flower-pots, and roused Mrs Gamp, whose voice--to the great satisfaction of the matrons--was heard to say, <qs/>'I'm coming.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="8" id="MC.c19.p8" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="MC.c19.s21"><qs/>'He's as pale as a muffin,'<qe/> said one lady, in allusion to Mr Pecksniff.</s> </p><p pid="9" id="MC.c19.p9" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="MC.c19.s22"><qs/>'So he ought to be, if he's the feelings of a man,'<qe/> observed another.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="MC.c19.p10"><s sid="23" id="MC.c19.s23">A third lady (with her arms folded) said she wished he had chosen any other time for fetching Mrs Gamp, but it always happened so with HER.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="MC.c19.p11"><s sid="24" id="MC.c19.s24">It gave Mr Pecksniff much uneasiness to find, from these remarks, that he was supposed to have come to Mrs Gamp upon an errand touching--not the close of life, but the other end.</s> <s sid="25" id="MC.c19.s25">Mrs Gamp herself was under the same impression, for, throwing open the window, she cried behind the curtains, as she hastily attired herself--</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="MC.c19.p12" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="MC.c19.s26"><qs/>'Is it Mrs Perkins?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="MC.c19.p13" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="MC.c19.s27"><qs/>'No!'<qe/> returned Mr Pecksniff, sharply.</s> <s sid="28" id="MC.c19.s28"><qs/>'Nothing of the sort.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="MC.c19.p14" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="MC.c19.s29"><qs/>'What, Mr Whilks!'<qe/> cried Mrs Gamp.</s> <s sid="30" id="MC.c19.s30"><qs/>'Don't say it's you, Mr Whilks, and that poor creetur Mrs Whilks with not even a pincushion ready.</s> <s sid="31" id="MC.c19.s31">Don't say it's you, Mr Whilks!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="MC.c19.p15" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="MC.c19.s32"><qs/>'It isn't Mr Whilks,'<qe/> said Pecksniff.</s> <s sid="33" id="MC.c19.s33"><qs/>'I don't know the man.</s> <s sid="34" id="MC.c19.s34">Nothing of the kind.</s> <s sid="35" id="MC.c19.s35">A gentleman is dead; and some person being wanted in the house, you have been recommended by Mr Mould the undertaker.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="16" id="MC.c19.p16" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="MC.c19.s36">As she was by this time in a condition to appear, Mrs Gamp, who had a face for all occasions, looked out of the window with her mourning countenance, and said she would be down directly.</s> <s sid="37" id="MC.c19.s37">But the matrons took it very ill that Mr Pecksniff's mission was of so unimportant a kind; and the lady with her arms folded rated him in good round terms, signifying that she would be glad to know what he meant by terrifying delicate females <qs/>'with his corpses;'<qe/> and giving it as her opinion that he was quite ugly enough to know better.</s> <s sid="38" id="MC.c19.s38">The other ladies were not at all behind-hand in expressing similar sentiments; and the children, of whom some scores had now collected, hooted and defied Mr Pecksniff quite savagely.</s> <s sid="39" id="MC.c19.s39">So when Mrs Gamp appeared, the unoffending gentleman was glad to hustle her with very little ceremony into the cabriolet, and drive off, overwhelmed with popular execration.</s> </p><p pid="17" id="MC.c19.p17" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="MC.c19.s40">Mrs Gamp had a large bundle with her, a pair of pattens, and a species of gig umbrella; the latter article in colour like a faded leaf, except where a circular patch of a lively blue had been dexterously let in at the top.</s> <s sid="41" id="MC.c19.s41">She was much flurried by the haste she had made, and laboured under the most erroneous views of cabriolets, which she appeared to confound with mail-coaches or stage-wagons, inasmuch as she was constantly endeavouring for the first half mile to force her luggage through the little front window, and clamouring to the driver to <qs/>'put it in the boot.'<qe/></s> <s sid="42" id="MC.c19.s42">When she was disabused of this idea, her whole being resolved itself into an absorbing anxiety about her pattens, with which she played innumerable games at quoits on Mr Pecksniff's legs.</s> <s sid="43" id="MC.c19.s43">It was not until they were close upon the house of mourning that she had enough composure to observe--</s> </p><p pid="18" id="MC.c19.p18" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="MC.c19.s44"><qs/>'And so the gentleman's dead, sir!</s> <s sid="45" id="MC.c19.s45">Ah!</s> <s sid="46" id="MC.c19.s46">The more's the pity.'<qe/></s> <s sid="47" id="MC.c19.s47">She didn't even know his name.</s> <s sid="48" id="MC.c19.s48"><qs/>'But it's what we must all come to.</s> <s sid="49" id="MC.c19.s49">It's as certain as being born, except that we can't make our calculations as exact.</s> <s sid="50" id="MC.c19.s50">Ah!</s> <s sid="51" id="MC.c19.s51">Poor dear!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="MC.c19.p19"><s sid="52" id="MC.c19.s52">She was a fat old woman, this Mrs Gamp, with a husky voice and a moist eye, which she had a remarkable power of turning up, and only showing the white of it.</s> <s sid="53" id="MC.c19.s53">Having very little neck, it cost her some trouble to look over herself, if one may say so, at those to whom she talked.</s> <s sid="54" id="MC.c19.s54">She wore a very rusty black gown, rather the worse for snuff, and a shawl and bonnet to correspond.</s> <s sid="55" id="MC.c19.s55">In these dilapidated articles of dress she had, on principle, arrayed herself, time out of mind, on such occasions as the present; for this at once expressed a decent amount of veneration for the deceased, and invited the next of kin to present her with a fresher suit of weeds; an appeal so frequently successful, that the very fetch and ghost of Mrs Gamp, bonnet and all, might be seen hanging up, any hour in the day, in at least a dozen of the second-hand clothes shops about Holborn.</s> <s sid="56" id="MC.c19.s56">The face of Mrs Gamp--the nose in particular--was somewhat red and swollen, and it was difficult to enjoy her society without becoming conscious of a smell of spirits.</s> <s sid="57" id="MC.c19.s57">Like most persons who have attained to great eminence in their profession, she took to hers very kindly; insomuch that, setting aside her natural predilections as a woman, she went to a lying-in or a laying-out with equal zest and relish.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="MC.c19.p20" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="MC.c19.s58"><qs/>'Ah!'<qe/> repeated Mrs Gamp; for it was always a safe sentiment in cases of mourning.</s> <s sid="59" id="MC.c19.s59"><qs/>'Ah dear!</s> <s sid="60" id="MC.c19.s60">When Gamp was summoned to his long home, and I see him a-lying in Guy's Hospital with a penny-piece on each eye, and his wooden leg under his left arm, I thought I should have fainted away.</s> <s sid="61" id="MC.c19.s61">But I bore up.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="21" id="MC.c19.p21"><s sid="62" id="MC.c19.s62">If certain whispers current in the Kingsgate Street circles had any truth in them, she had indeed borne up surprisingly; and had exerted such uncommon fortitude as to dispose of Mr Gamp's remains for the benefit of science.</s> <s sid="63" id="MC.c19.s63">But it should be added, in fairness, that this had happened twenty years before; and that Mr and Mrs Gamp had long been separated on the ground of incompatibility of temper in their drink.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="MC.c19.p22" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="MC.c19.s64"><qs/>'You have become indifferent since then, I suppose?'<qe/> said Mr Pecksniff.</s> <s sid="65" id="MC.c19.s65"><qs/>'Use is second nature, Mrs Gamp.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="MC.c19.p23" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="MC.c19.s66"><qs/>'You may well say second nater, sir,'<qe/> returned that lady.</s> <s sid="67" id="MC.c19.s67"><qs/>'One's first ways is to find sich things a trial to the feelings, and so is one's lasting custom.</s> <s sid="68" id="MC.c19.s68">If it wasn't for the nerve a little sip of liquor gives me (I never was able to do more than taste it), I never could go through with what I sometimes has to do.</s> <s sid="69" id="MC.c19.s69">"Mrs Harris," I says, at the very last case as ever I acted in, which it was but a young person, "Mrs Harris," I says, "leave the bottle on the chimley-piece, and don't ask me to take none, but let me put my lips to it when I am so dispoged, and then I will do what I'm engaged to do, according to the best of my ability."</s> <s sid="70" id="MC.c19.s70">"Mrs Gamp," she says, in answer, "if ever there was a sober creetur to be got at eighteen pence a day for working people, and three and six for gentlefolks-- night watching,"'<qe/><sls/> said Mrs Gamp with emphasis, <sle/><qs/>'"being a extra charge--you are that inwallable person."</s> <s sid="71" id="MC.c19.s71">"Mrs Harris," I says to her, "don't name the charge, for if I could afford to lay all my feller creeturs out for nothink, I would gladly do it, sich is the love I bears 'em.</s> <s sid="72" id="MC.c19.s72">But what I always says to them as has the management of matters, Mrs Harris"'<qe/><sls/>--here she kept her eye on Mr Pecksniff--<sle/><qs/>'"be they gents or be they ladies, is, don't ask me whether I won't take none, or whether I will, but leave the bottle on the chimley-piece, and let me put my lips to it when I am so dispoged."'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="24" id="MC.c19.p24"><s sid="73" id="MC.c19.s73">The conclusion of this affecting narrative brought them to the house.</s> <s sid="74" id="MC.c19.s74">In the passage they encountered Mr Mould the undertaker; a little elderly gentleman, bald, and in a suit of black; with a notebook in his hand, a massive gold watch-chain dangling from his fob, and a face in which a queer attempt at melancholy was at odds with a smirk of satisfaction; so that he looked as a man might, who, in the very act of smacking his lips over choice old wine, tried to make believe it was physic.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="MC.c19.p25" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="MC.c19.s75"><qs/>'Well, Mrs Gamp, and how are YOU, Mrs Gamp?'<qe/> said this gentleman, in a voice as soft as his step.</s> </p><p pid="26" id="MC.c19.p26" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="MC.c19.s76"><qs/>'Pretty well, I thank you, sir,'<qe/> dropping a curtsey.</s> </p><p pid="27" id="MC.c19.p27" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="MC.c19.s77"><qs/>'You'll be very particular here, Mrs Gamp.</s> <s sid="78" id="MC.c19.s78">This is not a common case, Mrs Gamp.</s> <s sid="79" id="MC.c19.s79">Let everything be very nice and comfortable, Mrs Gamp, if you please,'<qe/> said the undertaker, shaking his head with a solemn air.</s> </p><p pid="28" id="MC.c19.p28" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="MC.c19.s80"><qs/>'It shall be, sir,'<qe/> she replied, curtseying again.</s> <s sid="81" id="MC.c19.s81"><qs/>'You knows me of old, sir, I hope.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="29" id="MC.c19.p29" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="MC.c19.s82"><qs/>'I hope so, too, Mrs Gamp,'<qe/> said the undertaker.</s> <s sid="83" id="MC.c19.s83"><qs/>'and I think so also.'<qe/></s> <s sid="84" id="MC.c19.s84">Mrs Gamp curtseyed again.</s> <s sid="85" id="MC.c19.s85"><qs/>'This is one of the most impressive cases, sir,'<qe/><sls/> he continued, addressing Mr Pecksniff, <sle/><qs/>'that I have seen in the whole course of my professional experience.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="30" id="MC.c19.p30" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="MC.c19.s86"><qs/>'Indeed, Mr Mould!'<qe/> cried that gentleman.</s> </p><p pid="31" id="MC.c19.p31" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="MC.c19.s87"><qs/>'Such affectionate regret, sir, I never saw.</s> <s sid="88" id="MC.c19.s88">There is no limitation, there is positively NO limitation'<qe/><sls/>--opening his eyes wide, and standing on tiptoe--<sle/><qs/>'in point of expense!</s> <s sid="89" id="MC.c19.s89">I have orders, sir, to put on my whole establishment of mutes; and mutes come very dear, Mr Pecksniff; not to mention their drink.</s> <s sid="90" id="MC.c19.s90">To provide silver- plated handles of the very best description, ornamented with angels' heads from the most expensive dies.</s> <s sid="91" id="MC.c19.s91">To be perfectly profuse in feathers.</s> <s sid="92" id="MC.c19.s92">In short, sir, to turn out something absolutely gorgeous.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="32" id="MC.c19.p32" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="MC.c19.s93"><qs/>'My friend Mr Jonas is an excellent man,'<qe/> said Mr Pecksniff.</s> </p><p pid="33" id="MC.c19.p33" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="MC.c19.s94"><qs/>'I have seen a good deal of what is filial in my time, sir,'<qe/><sss/> retorted Mould, <sse/><qs/>'and what is unfilial too.</s> <s sid="95" id="MC.c19.s95">It is our lot.</s> <s sid="96" id="MC.c19.s96">We come into the knowledge of those secrets.</s> <s sid="97" id="MC.c19.s97">But anything so filial as this; anything so honourable to human nature; so calculated to reconcile all of us to the world we live in; never yet came under my observation.</s> <s sid="98" id="MC.c19.s98">It only proves, sir, what was so forcibly observed by the lamented theatrical poet--buried at Stratford--that there is good in everything.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="34" id="MC.c19.p34" type="speech"><s sid="99" id="MC.c19.s99"><qs/>'It is very pleasant to hear you say so, Mr Mould,'<qe/> observed Pecksniff.</s> </p><p pid="35" id="MC.c19.p35" type="speech"><s sid="100" id="MC.c19.s100"><qs/>'You are very kind, sir.</s> <s sid="101" id="MC.c19.s101">And what a man Mr Chuzzlewit was, sir!</s> <s sid="102" id="MC.c19.s102">Ah! what a man he was.</s> <s sid="103" id="MC.c19.s103">You may talk of your lord mayors,'<qe/><sls/> said Mould, waving his hand at the public in general, <sle/><qs/>'your sheriffs, your common councilmen, your trumpery; but show me a man in this city who is worthy to walk in the shoes of the departed Mr Chuzzlewit.</s> <s sid="104" id="MC.c19.s104">No, no,'<qe/> cried Mould, with bitter sarcasm.</s> <s sid="105" id="MC.c19.s105"><qs/>'Hang 'em up, hang 'em up; sole 'em and heel 'em, and have 'em ready for his son against he's old enough to wear 'em; but don't try 'em on yourselves, for they won't fit you.</s> <s sid="106" id="MC.c19.s106">We knew him,'<qe/><sls/> said Mould, in the same biting vein, as he pocketed his note-book; <sle/><qs/>'we knew him, and are not to be caught with chaff.</s> <s sid="107" id="MC.c19.s107">Mr Pecksniff, sir, good morning.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="36" id="MC.c19.p36"><s sid="108" id="MC.c19.s108">Mr Pecksniff returned the compliment; and Mould, sensible of having distinguished himself, was going away with a brisk smile, when he fortunately remembered the occasion.</s> <s sid="109" id="MC.c19.s109">Quickly becoming depressed again, he sighed; looked into the crown of his hat, as if for comfort; put it on without finding any; and slowly departed.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="MC.c19.p37"><s sid="110" id="MC.c19.s110">Mrs Gamp and Mr Pecksniff then ascended the staircase; and the former, having been shown to the chamber in which all that remained of Anthony Chuzzlewit lay covered up, with but one loving heart, and that a halting one, to mourn it, left the latter free to enter the darkened room below, and rejoin Mr Jonas, from whom he had now been absent nearly two hours.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="MC.c26.p1"><s sid="1" id="MC.c26.s1">The laws of sympathy between beards and birds, and the secret source of that attraction which frequently impels a shaver of the one to be a dealer in the other, are questions for the subtle reasoning of scientific bodies; not the less so, because their investigation would seem calculated to lead to no particular result.</s> <s sid="2" id="MC.c26.s2">It is enough to know that the artist who had the honour of entertaining Mrs Gamp as his first-floor lodger, united the two pursuits of barbering and bird-fancying; and that it was not an original idea of his, but one in which he had, dispersed about the by-streets and suburbs of the town, a host of rivals.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c26.p2"><s sid="3" id="MC.c26.s3">The name of the householder was Paul Sweedlepipe.</s> <s sid="4" id="MC.c26.s4">But he was commonly called Poll Sweedlepipe; and was not uncommonly believed to have been so christened, among his friends and neighbours.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c26.p3"><s sid="5" id="MC.c26.s5">With the exception of the staircase, and his lodger's private apartment, Poll Sweedlepipe's house was one great bird's nest.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c26.s6">Gamecocks resided in the kitchen; pheasants wasted the brightness of their golden plumage on the garret; bantams roosted in the cellar; owls had possession of the bedroom; and specimens of all the smaller fry of birds chirrupped and twittered in the shop.</s> <s sid="7" id="MC.c26.s7">The staircase was sacred to rabbits.</s> <s sid="8" id="MC.c26.s8">There in hutches of all shapes and kinds, made from old packing-cases, boxes, drawers, and tea-chests, they increased in a prodigious degree, and contributed their share towards that complicated whiff which, quite impartially, and without distinction of persons, saluted every nose that was put into Sweedlepipe's easy shaving-shop.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="MC.c26.p4"><s sid="9" id="MC.c26.s9">Many noses found their way there, for all that, especially on Sunday morning, before church-time.</s> <s sid="10" id="MC.c26.s10">Even archbishops shave, or must be shaved, on a Sunday, and beards WILL grow after twelve o'clock on Saturday night, though it be upon the chins of base mechanics; who, not being able to engage their valets by the quarter, hire them by the job, and pay them--oh, the wickedness of copper coin!--in dirty pence.</s> <s sid="11" id="MC.c26.s11">Poll Sweedlepipe, the sinner, shaved all comers at a penny each, and cut the hair of any customer for twopence; and being a lone unmarried man, and having some connection in the bird line, Poll got on tolerably well.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="MC.c26.p5"><s sid="12" id="MC.c26.s12">He was a little elderly man, with a clammy cold right hand, from which even rabbits and birds could not remove the smell of shaving- soap.</s> <s sid="13" id="MC.c26.s13">Poll had something of the bird in his nature; not of the hawk or eagle, but of the sparrow, that builds in chimney-stacks and inclines to human company.</s> <s sid="14" id="MC.c26.s14">He was not quarrelsome, though, like the sparrow; but peaceful, like the dove.</s> <s sid="15" id="MC.c26.s15">In his walk he strutted; and, in this respect, he bore a faint resemblance to the pigeon, as well as in a certain prosiness of speech, which might, in its monotony, be likened to the cooing of that bird.</s> <s sid="16" id="MC.c26.s16">He was very inquisitive; and when he stood at his shop-door in the evening-tide, watching the neighbours, with his head on one side, and his eye cocked knowingly, there was a dash of the raven in him.</s> <s sid="17" id="MC.c26.s17">Yet there was no more wickedness in Poll than in a robin.</s> <s sid="18" id="MC.c26.s18">Happily, too, when any of his ornithological properties were on the verge of going too far, they were quenched, dissolved, melted down, and neutralised in the barber; just as his bald head--otherwise, as the head of a shaved magpie-- lost itself in a wig of curly black ringlets, parted on one side, and cut away almost to the crown, to indicate immense capacity of intellect.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="MC.c26.p6"><s sid="19" id="MC.c26.s19">Poll had a very small, shrill treble voice, which might have led the wags of Kingsgate Street to insist the more upon his feminine designation.</s> <s sid="20" id="MC.c26.s20">He had a tender heart, too; for, when he had a good commission to provide three or four score sparrows for a shooting- match, he would observe, in a compassionate tone, how singular it was that sparrows should have been made expressly for such purposes.</s> <s sid="21" id="MC.c26.s21">The question, whether men were made to shoot them, never entered into Poll's philosophy.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="MC.c26.p7"><s sid="22" id="MC.c26.s22">Poll wore, in his sporting character, a velveteen coat, a great deal of blue stocking, ankle boots, a neckerchief of some bright colour, and a very tall hat.</s> <s sid="23" id="MC.c26.s23">Pursuing his more quiet occupation of barber, he generally subsided into an apron not over-clean, a flannel jacket, and corduroy knee-shorts.</s> <s sid="24" id="MC.c26.s24">It was in this latter costume, but with his apron girded round his waist, as a token of his having shut up shop for the night, that he closed the door one evening, some weeks after the occurrences detailed in the last chapter, and stood upon the steps in Kingsgate Street, listening until the little cracked bell within should leave off ringing.</s> <s sid="25" id="MC.c26.s25">For until it did-- this was Mr Sweedlepipe's reflection--the place never seemed quiet enough to be left to itself.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE MR PINCH IS DISCHARGED OF A DUTY WHICH HE NEVER OWED TO ANYBODY, AND MR PECKSNIFF DISCHARGES A DUTY WHICH HE OWES TO SOCIETY</title>

<p pid="1" id="MC.c31.p1"><s sid="1" id="MC.c31.s1">The closing words of the last chapter lead naturally to the commencement of this, its successor; for it has to do with a church.</s> <s sid="2" id="MC.c31.s2">With the church, so often mentioned heretofore, in which Tom Pinch played the organ for nothing.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c31.p2"><s sid="3" id="MC.c31.s3">One sultry afternoon, about a week after Miss Charity's departure for London, Mr Pecksniff being out walking by himself, took it into his head to stray into the churchyard.</s> <s sid="4" id="MC.c31.s4">As he was lingering among the tombstones, endeavouring to extract an available sentiment or two from the epitaphs--for he never lost an opportunity of making up a few moral crackers, to be let off as occasion served--Tom Pinch began to practice.</s> <s sid="5" id="MC.c31.s5">Tom could run down to the church and do so whenever he had time to spare; for it was a simple little organ, provided with wind by the action of the musician's feet; and he was independent, even of a bellows-blower.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c31.s6">Though if Tom had wanted one at any time, there was not a man or boy in all the village, and away to the turnpike (tollman included), but would have blown away for him till he was black in the face.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c31.p3"><s sid="7" id="MC.c31.s7">Mr Pecksniff had no objection to music; not the least.</s> <s sid="8" id="MC.c31.s8">He was tolerant of everything; he often said so.</s> <s sid="9" id="MC.c31.s9">He considered it a vagabond kind of trifling, in general, just suited to Tom's capacity.</s> <s sid="10" id="MC.c31.s10">But in regard to Tom's performance upon this same organ, he was remarkably lenient, singularly amiable; for when Tom played it on Sundays, Mr Pecksniff in his unbounded sympathy felt as if he played it himself, and were a benefactor to the congregation.</s> <s sid="11" id="MC.c31.s11">So whenever it was impossible to devise any other means of taking the value of Tom's wages out of him, Mr Pecksniff gave him leave to cultivate this instrument.</s> <s sid="12" id="MC.c31.s12">For which mark of his consideration Tom was very grateful.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="MC.c31.p4"><s sid="13" id="MC.c31.s13">The afternoon was remarkably warm, and Mr Pecksniff had been strolling a long way.</s> <s sid="14" id="MC.c31.s14">He had not what may be called a fine ear for music, but he knew when it had a tranquilizing influence on his soul; and that was the case now, for it sounded to him like a melodious snore.</s> <s sid="15" id="MC.c31.s15">He approached the church, and looking through the diamond lattice of a window near the porch, saw Tom, with the curtains in the loft drawn back, playing away with great expression and tenderness.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="MC.c31.p5"><s sid="16" id="MC.c31.s16">The church had an inviting air of coolness.</s> <s sid="17" id="MC.c31.s17">The old oak roof supported by cross-beams, the hoary walls, the marble tablets, and the cracked stone pavement, were refreshing to look at.</s> <s sid="18" id="MC.c31.s18">There were leaves of ivy tapping gently at the opposite windows; and the sun poured in through only one; leaving the body of the church in tempting shade.</s> <s sid="19" id="MC.c31.s19">But the most tempting spot of all, was one red- curtained and soft-cushioned pew, wherein the official dignitaries of the place (of whom Mr Pecksniff was the head and chief) enshrined themselves on Sundays.</s> <s sid="20" id="MC.c31.s20">Mr Pecksniff's seat was in the corner; a remarkably comfortable corner; where his very large Prayer-Book was at that minute making the most of its quarto self upon the desk.</s> <s sid="21" id="MC.c31.s21">He determined to go in and rest.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="MC.c31.p6"><s sid="22" id="MC.c31.s22">He entered very softly; in part because it was a church; in part because his tread was always soft; in part because Tom played a solemn tune; in part because he thought he would surprise him when he stopped.</s> <s sid="23" id="MC.c31.s23">Unbolting the door of the high pew of state, he glided in and shut it after him; then sitting in his usual place, and stretching out his legs upon the hassocks, he composed himself to listen to the music.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="MC.c31.p7"><s sid="24" id="MC.c31.s24">It is an unaccountable circumstance that he should have felt drowsy there, where the force of association might surely have been enough to keep him wide awake; but he did.</s> <s sid="25" id="MC.c31.s25">He had not been in the snug little corner five minutes before he began to nod.</s> <s sid="26" id="MC.c31.s26">He had not recovered himself one minute before he began to nod again.</s> <s sid="27" id="MC.c31.s27">In the very act of opening his eyes indolently, he nodded again.</s> <s sid="28" id="MC.c31.s28">In the very act of shutting them, he nodded again.</s> <s sid="29" id="MC.c31.s29">So he fell out of one nod into another until at last he ceased to nod at all, and was as fast as the church itself.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="MC.c31.p8"><s sid="30" id="MC.c31.s30">He had a consciousness of the organ, long after he fell asleep, though as to its being an organ he had no more idea of that than he had of its being a bull.</s> <s sid="31" id="MC.c31.s31">After a while he began to have at intervals the same dreamy impressions of voices; and awakening to an indolent curiosity upon the subject, opened his eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="MC.c31.p9"><s sid="32" id="MC.c31.s32">He was so indolent, that after glancing at the hassocks and the pew, he was already half-way off to sleep again, when it occurred to him that there really were voices in the church; low voices, talking earnestly hard by; while the echoes seemed to mutter responses.</s> <s sid="33" id="MC.c31.s33">He roused himself, and listened.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="MC.c31.p10"><s sid="34" id="MC.c31.s34">Before he had listened half a dozen seconds, he became as broad awake as ever he had been in all his life.</s> <s sid="35" id="MC.c31.s35">With eyes, and ears, and mouth, wide open, he moved himself a very little with the utmost caution, and gathering the curtain in his hand, peeped out.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="MC.c31.p11"><s sid="36" id="MC.c31.s36">Tom Pinch and Mary.</s> <s sid="37" id="MC.c31.s37">Of course.</s> <s sid="38" id="MC.c31.s38">He had recognized their voices, and already knew the topic they discussed.</s> <s sid="39" id="MC.c31.s39">Looking like the small end of a guillotined man, with his chin on a level with the top of the pew, so that he might duck down immediately in case of either of them turning round, he listened.</s> <s sid="40" id="MC.c31.s40">Listened with such concentrated eagerness, that his very hair and shirt-collar stood bristling up to help him.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c34.p2"><s sid="2" id="MC.c34.s2">He had straight black hair, parted up the middle of his head and hanging down upon his coat; a little fringe of hair upon his chin; wore no neckcloth; a white hat; a suit of black, long in the sleeves and short in the legs; soiled brown stockings and laced shoes.</s> <s sid="3" id="MC.c34.s3">His complexion, naturally muddy, was rendered muddier by too strict an economy of soap and water; and the same observation will apply to the washable part of his attire, which he might have changed with comfort to himself and gratification to his friends.</s> <s sid="4" id="MC.c34.s4">He was about five and thirty; was crushed and jammed up in a heap, under the shade of a large green cotton umbrella; and ruminated over his tobacco-plug like a cow.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c34.p3"><s sid="5" id="MC.c34.s5">He was not singular, to be sure, in these respects; for every gentleman on board appeared to have had a difference with his laundress and to have left off washing himself in early youth.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c34.s6">Every gentleman, too, was perfectly stopped up with tight plugging, and was dislocated in the greater part of his joints.</s> <s sid="7" id="MC.c34.s7">But about this gentleman there was a peculiar air of sagacity and wisdom, which convinced Martin that he was no common character; and this turned out to be the case.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX TOM PINCH DEPARTS TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE.  WHAT HE FINDS AT STARTING</title>

<p pid="1" id="MC.c36.p1"><s sid="1" id="MC.c36.s1">Oh!</s> <s sid="2" id="MC.c36.s2">What a different town Salisbury was in Tom Pinch's eyes to be sure, when the substantial Pecksniff of his heart melted away into an idle dream!</s> <s sid="3" id="MC.c36.s3">He possessed the same faith in the wonderful shops, the same intensified appreciation of the mystery and wickedness of the place; made the same exalted estimate of its wealth, population, and resources; and yet it was not the old city nor anything like it.</s> <s sid="4" id="MC.c36.s4">He walked into the market while they were getting breakfast ready for him at the Inn; and though it was the same market as of old, crowded by the same buyers and sellers; brisk with the same business; noisy with the same confusion of tongues and cluttering of fowls in coops; fair with the same display of rolls of butter, newly made, set forth in linen cloths of dazzling whiteness; green with the same fresh show of dewy vegetables; dainty with the same array in higglers' baskets of small shaving-glasses, laces, braces, trouser-straps, and hardware; savoury with the same unstinted show of delicate pigs' feet, and pies made precious by the pork that once had walked upon them; still it was strangely changed to Tom.</s> <s sid="5" id="MC.c36.s5">For, in the centre of the market-place, he missed a statue he had set up there as in all other places of his personal resort; and it looked cold and bare without that ornament.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c36.p2"><s sid="6" id="MC.c36.s6">The change lay no deeper than this, for Tom was far from being sage enough to know, that, having been disappointed in one man, it would have been a strictly rational and eminently wise proceeding to have revenged himself upon mankind in general, by mistrusting them one and all.</s> <s sid="7" id="MC.c36.s7">Indeed this piece of justice, though it is upheld by the authority of divers profound poets and honourable men, bears a nearer resemblance to the justice of that good Vizier in the Thousand-and-one Nights, who issues orders for the destruction of all the Porters in Bagdad because one of that unfortunate fraternity is supposed to have misconducted himself, than to any logical, not to say Christian, system of conduct, known to the world in later times.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c36.p3"><s sid="8" id="MC.c36.s8">Tom had so long been used to steep the Pecksniff of his fancy in his tea, and spread him out upon his toast, and take him as a relish with his beer, that he made but a poor breakfast on the first morning after his expulsion.</s> <s sid="9" id="MC.c36.s9">Nor did he much improve his appetite for dinner by seriously considering his own affairs, and taking counsel thereon with his friend the organist's assistant.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="MC.c36.p4"><s sid="10" id="MC.c36.s10">The organist's assistant gave it as his decided opinion that whatever Tom did, he must go to London; for there was no place like it.</s> <s sid="11" id="MC.c36.s11">Which may be true in the main, though hardly, perhaps, in itself, a sufficient reason for Tom's going there.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="MC.c36.p5" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="MC.c36.s12">But Tom had thought of London before, and had coupled with it thoughts of his sister, and of his old friend John Westlock, whose advice he naturally felt disposed to seek in this important crisis of his fortunes.</s> <s sid="13" id="MC.c36.s13">To London, therefore, he resolved to go; and he went away to the coach-office at once, to secure his place.</s> <s sid="14" id="MC.c36.s14">The coach being already full, he was obliged to postpone his departure until the next night; but even this circumstance had its bright side as well as its dark one, for though it threatened to reduce his poor purse with unexpected country charges, it afforded him an opportunity of writing to Mrs Lupin and appointing his box to be brought to the old finger-post at the old time; which would enable him to take that treasure with him to the metropolis, and save the expense of its carriage.</s> <s sid="15" id="MC.c36.s15"><qs/>'So,'<qe/><sss/> said Tom, comforting himself, <sse/><qs/>'it's very nearly as broad as it's long.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="MC.c36.p6"><s sid="16" id="MC.c36.s16">And it cannot be denied that, when he had made up his mind to even this extent, he felt an unaccustomed sense of freedom--a vague and indistinct impression of holiday-making--which was very luxurious.</s> <s sid="17" id="MC.c36.s17">He had his moments of depression and anxiety, and they were, with good reason, pretty numerous; but still, it was wonderfully pleasant to reflect that he was his own master, and could plan and scheme for himself.</s> <s sid="18" id="MC.c36.s18">It was startling, thrilling, vast, difficult to understand; it was a stupendous truth, teeming with responsibility and self-distrust; but in spite of all his cares, it gave a curious relish to the viands at the Inn, and interposed a dreamy haze between him and his prospects, in which they sometimes showed to magical advantage.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="MC.c36.p7"><s sid="19" id="MC.c36.s19">In this unsettled state of mind, Tom went once more to bed in the low four-poster, to the same immovable surprise of the effigies of the former landlord and the fat ox; and in this condition, passed the whole of the succeeding day.</s> <s sid="20" id="MC.c36.s20">When the coach came round at last with 'London' blazoned in letters of gold upon the boot, it gave Tom such a turn, that he was half disposed to run away.</s> <s sid="21" id="MC.c36.s21">But he didn't do it; for he took his seat upon the box instead, and looking down upon the four greys, felt as if he were another grey himself, or, at all events, a part of the turn-out; and was quite confused by the novelty and splendour of his situation.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="MC.c36.p8"><s sid="22" id="MC.c36.s22">And really it might have confused a less modest man than Tom to find himself sitting next that coachman; for of all the swells that ever flourished a whip professionally, he might have been elected emperor.</s> <s sid="23" id="MC.c36.s23">He didn't handle his gloves like another man, but put them on--even when he was standing on the pavement, quite detached from the coach--as if the four greys were, somehow or other, at the ends of the fingers.</s> <s sid="24" id="MC.c36.s24">It was the same with his hat.</s> <s sid="25" id="MC.c36.s25">He did things with his hat, which nothing but an unlimited knowledge of horses and the wildest freedom of the road, could ever have made him perfect in.</s> <s sid="26" id="MC.c36.s26">Valuable little parcels were brought to him with particular instructions, and he pitched them into this hat, and stuck it on again; as if the laws of gravity did not admit of such an event as its being knocked off or blown off, and nothing like an accident could befall it.</s> <s sid="27" id="MC.c36.s27">The guard, too!</s> <s sid="28" id="MC.c36.s28">Seventy breezy miles a day were written in his very whiskers.</s> <s sid="29" id="MC.c36.s29">His manners were a canter; his conversation a round trot.</s> <s sid="30" id="MC.c36.s30">He was a fast coach upon a down-hill turnpike road; he was all pace.</s> <s sid="31" id="MC.c36.s31">A waggon couldn't have moved slowly, with that guard and his key-bugle on the top of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="MC.c36.p9"><s sid="32" id="MC.c36.s32">These were all foreshadowings of London, Tom thought, as he sat upon the box, and looked about him.</s> <s sid="33" id="MC.c36.s33">Such a coachman, and such a guard, never could have existed between Salisbury and any other place.</s> <s sid="34" id="MC.c36.s34">The coach was none of your steady-going, yokel coaches, but a swaggering, rakish, dissipated London coach; up all night, and lying by all day, and leading a devil of a life.</s> <s sid="35" id="MC.c36.s35">It cared no more for Salisbury than if it had been a hamlet.</s> <s sid="36" id="MC.c36.s36">It rattled noisily through the best streets, defied the Cathedral, took the worst corners sharpest, went cutting in everywhere, making everything get out of its way; and spun along the open country-road, blowing a lively defiance out of its key-bugle, as its last glad parting legacy.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="MC.c36.p10"><s sid="37" id="MC.c36.s37">It was a charming evening.</s> <s sid="38" id="MC.c36.s38">Mild and bright.</s> <s sid="39" id="MC.c36.s39">And even with the weight upon his mind which arose out of the immensity and uncertainty of London, Tom could not resist the captivating sense of rapid motion through the pleasant air.</s> <s sid="40" id="MC.c36.s40">The four greys skimmed along, as if they liked it quite as well as Tom did; the bugle was in as high spirits as the greys; the coachman chimed in sometimes with his voice; the wheels hummed cheerfully in unison; the brass work on the harness was an orchestra of little bells; and thus, as they went clinking, jingling, rattling smoothly on, the whole concern, from the buckles of the leaders' coupling-reins to the handle of the hind boot, was one great instrument of music.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="MC.c36.p11"><s sid="41" id="MC.c36.s41">Yoho, past hedges, gates, and trees; past cottages and barns, and people going home from work.</s> <s sid="42" id="MC.c36.s42">Yoho, past donkey-chaises, drawn aside into the ditch, and empty carts with rampant horses, whipped up at a bound upon the little watercourse, and held by struggling carters close to the five-barred gate, until the coach had passed the narrow turning in the road.</s> <s sid="43" id="MC.c36.s43">Yoho, by churches dropped down by themselves in quiet nooks, with rustic burial-grounds about them, where the graves are green, and daisies sleep--for it is evening--on the bosoms of the dead.</s> <s sid="44" id="MC.c36.s44">Yoho, past streams, in which the cattle cool their feet, and where the rushes grow; past paddock-fences, farms, and rick-yards; past last year's stacks, cut, slice by slice, away, and showing, in the waning light, like ruined gables, old and brown.</s> <s sid="45" id="MC.c36.s45">Yoho, down the pebbly dip, and through the merry water-splash and up at a canter to the level road again.</s> <s sid="46" id="MC.c36.s46">Yoho!</s> <s sid="47" id="MC.c36.s47">Yoho!</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="MC.c36.p12"><s sid="48" id="MC.c36.s48">Was the box there, when they came up to the old finger-post?</s> <s sid="49" id="MC.c36.s49">The box!</s> <s sid="50" id="MC.c36.s50">Was Mrs Lupin herself?</s> <s sid="51" id="MC.c36.s51">Had she turned out magnificently as a hostess should, in her own chaise-cart, and was she sitting in a mahogany chair, driving her own horse Dragon (who ought to have been called Dumpling), and looking lovely?</s> <s sid="52" id="MC.c36.s52">Did the stage-coach pull up beside her, shaving her very wheel, and even while the guard helped her man up with the trunk, did he send the glad echoes of his bugle careering down the chimneys of the distant Pecksniff, as if the coach expressed its exultation in the rescue of Tom Pinch?</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="MC.c36.p13" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="MC.c36.s53"><qs/>'This is kind indeed!'<qe/> said Tom, bending down to shake hands with her.</s> <s sid="54" id="MC.c36.s54"><qs/>'I didn't mean to give you this trouble.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="MC.c36.p14" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="MC.c36.s55"><qs/>'Trouble, Mr Pinch!'<qe/> cried the hostess of the Dragon.</s> </p><p pid="15" id="MC.c36.p15" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="MC.c36.s56"><qs/>'Well!</s> <s sid="57" id="MC.c36.s57">It's a pleasure to you, I know,'<qe/> said Tom, squeezing her hand heartily.</s> <s sid="58" id="MC.c36.s58"><qs/>'Is there any news?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="16" id="MC.c36.p16"><s sid="59" id="MC.c36.s59">The hostess shook her head.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN TOM PINCH, GOING ASTRAY, FINDS THAT HE IS NOT THE ONLY PERSON IN THAT PREDICAMENT.  HE RETALIATES UPON A FALLEN FOE</title>

<p pid="1" id="MC.c37.p1"><s sid="1" id="MC.c37.s1">Tom's evil genius did not lead him into the dens of any of those preparers of cannibalic pastry, who are represented in many standard country legends as doing a lively retail business in the Metropolis; nor did it mark him out as the prey of ring-droppers, pea and thimble-riggers, duffers, touters, or any of those bloodless sharpers, who are, perhaps, a little better known to the Police.</s> <s sid="2" id="MC.c37.s2">He fell into conversation with no gentleman who took him into a public- house, where there happened to be another gentleman who swore he had more money than any gentleman, and very soon proved he had more money than one gentleman by taking his away from him; neither did he fall into any other of the numerous man-traps which are set up without notice, in the public grounds of this city.</s> <s sid="3" id="MC.c37.s3">But he lost his way.</s> <s sid="4" id="MC.c37.s4">He very soon did that; and in trying to find it again he lost it more and more.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c37.p2"><s sid="5" id="MC.c37.s5">Now, Tom, in his guileless distrust of London, thought himself very knowing in coming to the determination that he would not ask to be directed to Furnival's Inn, if he could help it; unless, indeed, he should happen to find himself near the Mint, or the Bank of England; in which case he would step in, and ask a civil question or two, confiding in the perfect respectability of the concern.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c37.s6">So on he went, looking up all the streets he came near, and going up half of them; and thus, by dint of not being true to Goswell Street, and filing off into Aldermanbury, and bewildering himself in Barbican, and being constant to the wrong point of the compass in London Wall, and then getting himself crosswise into Thames Street, by an instinct that would have been marvellous if he had had the least desire or reason to go there, he found himself, at last, hard by the Monument.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="MC.c37.p4"><s sid="10" id="MC.c37.s10">Coming close below the pillar, it was a great encouragement to Tom to find that the Man in the Monument had simple tastes; that stony and artificial as his residence was, he still preserved some rustic recollections; that he liked plants, hung up bird-cages, was not wholly cut off from fresh groundsel, and kept young trees in tubs.</s> <s sid="11" id="MC.c37.s11">The Man in the Monument, himself, was sitting outside the door--his own door: the Monument-door: what a grand idea!--and was actually yawning, as if there were no Monument to stop his mouth, and give him a perpetual interest in his own existence.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="MC.c38.p7"><s sid="20" id="MC.c38.s20">Mr Nadgett made a mysterious change about this time in his mysterious life: for whereas he had, until now, been first seen every morning coming down Cornhill, so exactly like the Nadgett of the day before as to occasion a popular belief that he never went to bed or took his clothes off, he was now first seen in Holborn, coming out of Kingsgate Street; and it was soon discovered that he actually went every morning to a barber's shop in that street to get shaved; and that the barber's name was Sweedlepipe.</s> <s sid="21" id="MC.c38.s21">He seemed to make appointments with the man who never came, to meet him at this barber's; for he would frequently take long spells of waiting in the shop, and would ask for pen and ink, and pull out his pocket-book, and be very busy over it for an hour at a time.</s> <s sid="22" id="MC.c38.s22">Mrs Gamp and Mr Sweedlepipe had many deep discoursings on the subject of this mysterious customer; but they usually agreed that he had speculated too much and was keeping out of the way.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="MC.c38.p8"><s sid="23" id="MC.c38.s23">He must have appointed the man who never kept his word, to meet him at another new place too; for one day he was found, for the first time, by the waiter at the Mourning Coach-Horse, the House-of-call for Undertakers, down in the City there, making figures with a pipe- stem in the sawdust of a clean spittoon; and declining to call for anything, on the ground of expecting a gentleman presently.</s> <s sid="24" id="MC.c38.s24">As the gentleman was not honourable enough to keep his engagement, he came again next day, with his pocket-book in such a state of distention that he was regarded in the bar as a man of large property.</s> <s sid="25" id="MC.c38.s25">After that, he repeated his visits every day, and had so much writing to do, that he made nothing of emptying a capacious leaden inkstand in two sittings.</s> <s sid="26" id="MC.c38.s26">Although he never talked much, still, by being there among the regular customers, he made their acquaintance.  and in course of time became quite intimate with Mr Tacker, Mr Mould's foreman; and even with Mr Mould himself, who openly said he was a long-headed man, a dry one, a salt fish, a deep file, a rasper; and made him the subject of many other flattering encomiums.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="MC.c38.p9"><s sid="27" id="MC.c38.s27">At the same time, too, he told the people at the Assurance Office, in his own mysterious way, that there was something wrong (secretly wrong, of course) in his liver, and that he feared he must put himself under the doctor's hands.</s> <s sid="28" id="MC.c38.s28">He was delivered over to Jobling upon this representation; and though Jobling could not find out where his liver was wrong, wrong Mr Nadgett said it was; observing that it was his own liver, and he hoped he ought to know.</s> <s sid="29" id="MC.c38.s29">Accordingly, he became Mr Jobling's patient; and detailing his symptoms in his slow and secret way, was in and out of that gentleman's room a dozen times a day.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="MC.c38.p10"><s sid="30" id="MC.c38.s30">As he pursued all these occupations at once; and all steadily; and all secretly; and never slackened in his watchfulness of everything that Mr Jonas said and did, and left unsaid and undone; it is not improbable that they were, secretly, essential parts of some great scheme which Mr Nadgett had on foot.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c40.p2"><s sid="3" id="MC.c40.s3">It seemed to Tom, every morning, that he approached this ghostly mist, and became enveloped in it, by the easiest succession of degrees imaginable.</s> <s sid="4" id="MC.c40.s4">Passing from the roar and rattle of the streets into the quiet court-yards of the Temple, was the first preparation.</s> <s sid="5" id="MC.c40.s5">Every echo of his footsteps sounded to him like a sound from the old walls and pavements, wanting language to relate the histories of the dim, dismal rooms; to tell him what lost documents were decaying in forgotten corners of the shut-up cellars, from whose lattices such mouldy sighs came breathing forth as he went past; to whisper of dark bins of rare old wine, bricked up in vaults among the old foundations of the Halls; or mutter in a lower tone yet darker legends of the cross-legged knights, whose marble effigies were in the church.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c40.s6">With the first planting of his foot upon the staircase of his dusty office, all these mysteries increased; until, ascending step by step, as Tom ascended, they attained their full growth in the solitary labours of the day.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c40.p3"><s sid="7" id="MC.c40.s7">Every day brought one recurring, never-failing source of speculation.</s> <s sid="8" id="MC.c40.s8">This employer; would he come to-day, and what would he be like?</s> <s sid="9" id="MC.c40.s9">For Tom could not stop short at Mr Fips; he quite believed that Mr Fips had spoken truly, when he said he acted for another; and what manner of man that other was, became a full-blown flower of wonder in the garden of Tom's fancy, which never faded or got trodden down.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="MC.c40.p4"><s sid="10" id="MC.c40.s10">At one time, he conceived that Mr Pecksniff, repenting of his falsehood, might, by exertion of his influence with some third person have devised these means of giving him employment.</s> <s sid="11" id="MC.c40.s11">He found this idea so insupportable after what had taken place between that good man and himself, that he confided it to John Westlock on the very same day; informing John that he would rather ply for hire as a porter, than fall so low in his own esteem as to accept the smallest obligation from the hands of Mr Pecksniff.</s> <s sid="12" id="MC.c40.s12">But John assured him that he (Tom Pinch) was far from doing justice to the character of Mr Pecksniff yet, if he supposed that gentleman capable of performing a generous action; and that he might make his mind quite easy on that head until he saw the sun turn green and the moon black, and at the same time distinctly perceived with the naked eye, twelve first-rate comets careering round those planets.</s> <s sid="13" id="MC.c40.s13">In which unusual state of things, he said (and not before), it might become not absolutely lunatic to suspect Mr Pecksniff of anything so monstrous.</s> <s sid="14" id="MC.c40.s14">In short he laughed the idea down completely; and Tom, abandoning it, was thrown upon his beam-ends again, for some other solution.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="MC.c40.p5"><s sid="15" id="MC.c40.s15">In the meantime Tom attended to his duties daily, and made considerable progress with the books; which were already reduced to some sort of order, and made a great appearance in his fairly- written catalogue.</s> <s sid="16" id="MC.c40.s16">During his business hours, he indulged himself occasionally with snatches of reading; which were often, indeed, a necessary part of his pursuit; and as he usually made bold to carry one of these goblin volumes home at night (always bringing it back again next morning, in case his strange employer should appear and ask what had become of it), he led a happy, quiet, studious kind of life, after his own heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="MC.c40.p6" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="MC.c40.s17">But though the books were never so interesting, and never so full of novelty to Tom, they could not so enchain him, in those mysterious chambers, as to render him unconscious, for a moment, of the lightest sound.</s> <s sid="18" id="MC.c40.s18">Any footstep on the flags without set him listening attentively and when it turned into that house, and came up, up, up the stairs, he always thought with a beating heart, <qs/>'Now I am coming face to face with him at last!'<qe/></s> <s sid="19" id="MC.c40.s19">But no footstep ever passed the floor immediately below: except his own.</s> </p><p pid="7" id="MC.c40.p7"><s sid="20" id="MC.c40.s20">This mystery and loneliness engendered fancies in Tom's mind, the folly of which his common sense could readily discover, but which his common sense was quite unable to keep away, notwithstanding; that quality being with most of us, in such a case, like the old French Police--quick at detection, but very weak as a preventive power.</s> <s sid="21" id="MC.c40.s21">Misgivings, undefined, absurd, inexplicable, that there was some one hiding in the inner room--walking softly overhead, peeping in through the door-chink, doing something stealthy, anywhere where he was not--came over him a hundred times a day, making it pleasant to throw up the sash, and hold communication even with the sparrows who had built in the roof and water-spout, and were twittering about the windows all day long.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="MC.c40.p8" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="MC.c40.s22">He sat with the outer door wide open, at all times, that he might hear the footsteps as they entered, and turned off into the chambers on the lower floor.</s> <s sid="23" id="MC.c40.s23">He formed odd prepossessions too, regarding strangers in the streets; and would say within himself of such or such a man, who struck him as having anything uncommon in his dress or aspect, <qs/>'I shouldn't wonder, now, if that were he!'<qe/></s> <s sid="24" id="MC.c40.s24">But it never was.</s> <s sid="25" id="MC.c40.s25">And though he actually turned back and followed more than one of these suspected individuals, in a singular belief that they were going to the place he was then upon his way from, he never got any other satisfaction by it, than the satisfaction of knowing it was not the case.</s> </p><p pid="9" id="MC.c40.p9"><s sid="26" id="MC.c40.s26">Mr Fips, of Austin Friars, rather deepened than illumined the obscurity of his position; for on the first occasion of Tom's waiting on him to receive his weekly pay, he said:</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="MC.c40.p10" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="MC.c40.s27"><qs/>'Oh! by the bye, Mr Pinch, you needn't mention it, if you please!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="MC.c40.p11" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="MC.c40.s28">Tom thought he was going to tell him a secret; so he said that he wouldn't on any account, and that Mr Fips might entirely depend upon him.</s> <s sid="29" id="MC.c40.s29">But as Mr Fips said <qs/>'Very good,'<qe/> in reply, and nothing more, Tom prompted him:</s> </p><p pid="12" id="MC.c40.p12" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="MC.c40.s30"><qs/>'Not on any account,'<qe/> repeated Tom.</s> </p><p pid="13" id="MC.c40.p13" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="MC.c40.s31">Mr Fips repeated:</s> <s sid="32" id="MC.c40.s32"><qs/>'Very good.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="MC.c40.p14" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="MC.c40.s33"><qs/>'You were going to say'<qe/>--Tom hinted.</s> </p><p pid="15" id="MC.c40.p15" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="MC.c40.s34"><qs/>'Oh dear no!'<qe/> cried Fips.</s> <s sid="35" id="MC.c40.s35"><qs/>'Not at all.'<qe/></s> <s sid="36" id="MC.c40.s36">However, seeing Tom confused, he added, <qs/>'I mean that you needn't mention any particulars about your place of employment, to people generally.</s> <s sid="37" id="MC.c40.s37">You'll find it better not.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="16" id="MC.c40.p16" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="MC.c40.s38"><qs/>'I have not had the pleasure of seeing my employer yet, sir,'<qe/> observed Tom, putting his week's salary in his pocket.</s> </p><p pid="17" id="MC.c40.p17" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="MC.c40.s39"><qs/>'Haven't you?'<qe/> said Fips.</s> <s sid="40" id="MC.c40.s40"><qs/>'No, I don't suppose you have though.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="18" id="MC.c40.p18" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="MC.c40.s41"><qs/>'I should like to thank him, and to know that what I have done so far, is done to his satisfaction,'<qe/> faltered Tom.</s> </p><p pid="19" id="MC.c40.p19" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="MC.c40.s42"><qs/>'Quite right,'<qe/> said Mr Fips, with a yawn.</s> <s sid="43" id="MC.c40.s43"><qs/>'Highly creditable.</s> <s sid="44" id="MC.c40.s44">Very proper.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="20" id="MC.c40.p20"><s sid="45" id="MC.c40.s45">Tom hastily resolved to try him on another tack.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="MC.c40.p21" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="MC.c40.s46"><qs/>'I shall soon have finished with the books,'<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="47" id="MC.c40.s47"><qs/>'I hope that will not terminate my engagement, sir, or render me useless?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="22" id="MC.c40.p22" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="MC.c40.s48"><qs/>'Oh dear no!'<qe/> retorted Fips.</s> <s sid="49" id="MC.c40.s49"><qs/>'Plenty to do; plen-ty to do!</s> <s sid="50" id="MC.c40.s50">Be careful how you go.</s> <s sid="51" id="MC.c40.s51">It's rather dark.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="MC.c40.p23"><s sid="52" id="MC.c40.s52">This was the very utmost extent of information Tom could ever get out of HIM.</s> <s sid="53" id="MC.c40.s53">So it was dark enough in all conscience; and if Mr Fips expressed himself with a double meaning, he had good reason for doing so.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="MC.c40.p24"><s sid="54" id="MC.c40.s54">But now a circumstance occurred, which helped to divert Tom's thoughts from even this mystery, and to divide them between it and a new channel, which was a very Nile in itself.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="MC.c40.p25"><s sid="55" id="MC.c40.s55">The way it came about was this.</s> <s sid="56" id="MC.c40.s56">Having always been an early riser and having now no organ to engage him in sweet converse every morning, it was his habit to take a long walk before going to the Temple; and naturally inclining, as a stranger, towards those parts of the town which were conspicuous for the life and animation pervading them, he became a great frequenter of the market-places, bridges, quays, and especially the steam-boat wharves; for it was very lively and fresh to see the people hurrying away upon their many schemes of business or pleasure, and it made Tom glad to think that there was that much change and freedom in the monotonous routine of city lives.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="MC.c40.p26"><s sid="57" id="MC.c40.s57">In most of these morning excursions Ruth accompanied him.</s> <s sid="58" id="MC.c40.s58">As their landlord was always up and away at his business (whatever that might be, no one seemed to know) at a very early hour, the habits of the people of the house in which they lodged corresponded with their own.</s> <s sid="59" id="MC.c40.s59">Thus they had often finished their breakfast, and were out in the summer air, by seven o'clock.</s> <s sid="60" id="MC.c40.s60">After a two hours' stroll they parted at some convenient point; Tom going to the Temple, and his sister returning home, as methodically as you please.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="MC.c40.p27"><s sid="61" id="MC.c40.s61">Many and many a pleasant stroll they had in Covent Garden Market; snuffing up the perfume of the fruits and flowers, wondering at the magnificence of the pineapples and melons; catching glimpses down side avenues, of rows and rows of old women, seated on inverted baskets, shelling peas; looking unutterable things at the fat bundles of asparagus with which the dainty shops were fortified as with a breastwork; and, at the herbalist's doors, gratefully inhaling scents as of veal-stuffing yet uncooked, dreamily mixed up with capsicums, brown-paper, seeds, even with hints of lusty snails and fine young curly leeches.</s> <s sid="62" id="MC.c40.s62">Many and many a pleasant stroll they had among the poultry markets, where ducks and fowls, with necks unnaturally long, lay stretched out in pairs, ready for cooking; where there were speckled eggs in mossy baskets, white country sausages beyond impeachment by surviving cat or dog, or horse or donkey; new cheeses to any wild extent, live birds in coops and cages, looking much too big to be natural, in consequence of those receptacles being much too little; rabbits, alive and dead, innumerable.</s> <s sid="63" id="MC.c40.s63">Many a pleasant stroll they had among the cool, refreshing, silvery fish-stalls, with a kind of moonlight effect about their stock-in-trade, excepting always for the ruddy lobsters.</s> <s sid="64" id="MC.c40.s64">Many a pleasant stroll among the waggon-loads of fragrant hay, beneath which dogs and tired waggoners lay fast asleep, oblivious of the pieman and the public-house.</s> <s sid="65" id="MC.c40.s65">But never half so good a stroll as down among the steamboats on a bright morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="MC.c40.p28"><s sid="66" id="MC.c40.s66">There they lay, alongside of each other; hard and fast for ever, to all appearance, but designing to get out somehow, and quite confident of doing it; and in that faith shoals of passengers, and heaps of luggage, were proceeding hurriedly on board.</s> <s sid="67" id="MC.c40.s67">Little steam- boats dashed up and down the stream incessantly.</s> <s sid="68" id="MC.c40.s68">Tiers upon tiers of vessels, scores of masts, labyrinths of tackle, idle sails, splashing oars, gliding row-boats, lumbering barges, sunken piles, with ugly lodgings for the water-rat within their mud-discoloured nooks; church steeples, warehouses, house-roofs, arches, bridges, men and women, children, casks, cranes, boxes horses, coaches, idlers, and hard-labourers; there they were, all jumbled up together, any summer morning, far beyond Tom's power of separation.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="MC.c40.p29" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="MC.c40.s69">In the midst of all this turmoil there was an incessant roar from every packet's funnel, which quite expressed and carried out the uppermost emotion of the scene.</s> <s sid="70" id="MC.c40.s70">They all appeared to be perspiring and bothering themselves, exactly as their passengers did; they never left off fretting and chafing, in their own hoarse manner, once; but were always panting out, without any stops, <qs/>'Come along do make haste I'm very nervous come along oh good gracious we shall never get there how late you are do make haste I'm off directly come along!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="30" id="MC.c40.p30" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="MC.c40.s71">Even when they had left off, and had got safely out into the current, on the smallest provocation they began again; for the bravest packet of them all, being stopped by some entanglement in the river, would immediately begin to fume and pant afresh, <qs/>'oh here's a stoppage what's the matter do go on there I'm in a hurry it's done on purpose did you ever oh my goodness DO go on here!'<qe/> and so, in a state of mind bordering on distraction, would be last seen drifting slowly through the mist into the summer light beyond, that made it red.</s> </p><p pid="31" id="MC.c40.p31"><s sid="72" id="MC.c40.s72">Tom's ship, however; or, at least, the packet-boat in which Tom and his sister took the greatest interest on one particular occasion; was not off yet, by any means; but was at the height of its disorder.</s> <s sid="73" id="MC.c40.s73">The press of passengers was very great; another steam- boat lay on each side of her; the gangways were choked up; distracted women, obviously bound for Gravesend, but turning a deaf ear to all representations that this particular vessel was about to sail for Antwerp, persisted in secreting baskets of refreshments behind bulk-heads, and water-casks, and under seats; and very great confusion prevailed.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="MC.c40.p32"><s sid="74" id="MC.c40.s74">It was so amusing, that Tom, with Ruth upon his arm, stood looking down from the wharf, as nearly regardless as it was in the nature of flesh and blood to be, of an elderly lady behind him, who had brought a large umbrella with her, and didn't know what to do with it.</s> <s sid="75" id="MC.c40.s75">This tremendous instrument had a hooked handle; and its vicinity was first made known to him by a painful pressure on the windpipe, consequent upon its having caught him round the throat.</s> <s sid="76" id="MC.c40.s76">Soon after disengaging himself with perfect good humour, he had a sensation of the ferule in his back; immediately afterwards, of the hook entangling his ankles; then of the umbrella generally, wandering about his hat, and flapping at it like a great bird; and, lastly, of a poke or thrust below the ribs, which give him such exceeding anguish, that he could not refrain from turning round to offer a mild remonstrance.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="MC.c40.p33"><s sid="77" id="MC.c40.s77">Upon his turning round, he found the owner of the umbrella struggling on tip-toe, with a countenance expressive of violent animosity, to look down upon the steam-boats; from which he inferred that she had attacked him, standing in the front row, by design, and as her natural enemy.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="MC.c40.p34" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="MC.c40.s78"><qs/>'What a very ill-natured person you must be!'<qe/> said Tom.</s> </p><p pid="35" id="MC.c40.p35" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="MC.c40.s79">The lady cried out fiercely, <qs/>'Where's the pelisse!'<qe/>--meaning the constabulary--and went on to say, shaking the handle of the umbrella at Tom, that but for them fellers never being in the way when they was wanted, she'd have given him in charge, she would.</s> </p><p pid="36" id="MC.c40.p36" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="MC.c40.s80"><qs/>'If they greased their whiskers less, and minded the duties which they're paid so heavy for, a little more,'<qe/><sss/> she observed, <sse/><qs/>'no one needn't be drove mad by scrouding so!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="37" id="MC.c40.p37"><s sid="81" id="MC.c40.s81">She had been grievously knocked about, no doubt, for her bonnet was bent into the shape of a cocked hat.</s> <s sid="82" id="MC.c40.s82">Being a fat little woman, too, she was in a state of great exhaustion and intense heat.</s> <s sid="83" id="MC.c40.s83">Instead of pursuing the altercation, therefore, Tom civilly inquired what boat she wanted to go on board of?</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="MC.c40.p38" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="MC.c40.s84"><qs/>'I suppose,'<qe/><sss/> returned the lady, <sse/><qs/>'as nobody but yourself can want to look at a steam package, without wanting to go a-boarding of it, can they!</s> <s sid="85" id="MC.c40.s85">Booby!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="39" id="MC.c40.p39" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="MC.c40.s86"><qs/>'Which one do you want to look at then?'<qe/> said Tom.</s> <s sid="87" id="MC.c40.s87"><qs/>'We'll make room for you if we can.</s> <s sid="88" id="MC.c40.s88">Don't be so ill-tempered.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="40" id="MC.c40.p40" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="MC.c40.s89"><qs/>'No blessed creetur as ever I was with in trying times,'<qe/><sls/> returned the lady, somewhat softened, <sle/><qs/>'and they're a many in their numbers, ever brought it as a charge again myself that I was anythin' but mild and equal in my spirits.</s> <s sid="90" id="MC.c40.s90">Never mind a contradicting of me, if you seem to feel it does you good, ma'am, I often says, for well you know that Sairey may be trusted not to give it back again.</s> <s sid="91" id="MC.c40.s91">But I will not denige that I am worrited and wexed this day, and with good reagion, Lord forbid!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="41" id="MC.c40.p41"><s sid="92" id="MC.c40.s92">By this time, Mrs Gamp (for it was no other than that experienced practitioner) had, with Tom's assistance, squeezed and worked herself into a small corner between Ruth and the rail; where, after breathing very hard for some little time, and performing a short series of dangerous evolutions with her umbrella, she managed to establish herself pretty comfortably.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="MC.c40.p42" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="MC.c40.s93"><qs/>'And which of all them smoking monsters is the Ankworks boat, I wonder.</s> <s sid="94" id="MC.c40.s94">Goodness me!'<qe/> cried Mrs Gamp.</s> </p><p pid="43" id="MC.c40.p43" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="MC.c40.s95"><qs/>'What boat did you want?'<qe/> asked Ruth.</s> </p><p pid="44" id="MC.c40.p44" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="MC.c40.s96"><qs/>'The Ankworks package,'<qe/> Mrs Gamp replied.</s> <s sid="97" id="MC.c40.s97"><qs/>'I will not deceive you, my sweet.</s> <s sid="98" id="MC.c40.s98">Why should I?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="45" id="MC.c40.p45" type="speech"><s sid="99" id="MC.c40.s99"><qs/>'That is the Antwerp packet in the middle,'<qe/> said Ruth.</s> </p><p pid="46" id="MC.c40.p46" type="speech"><s sid="100" id="MC.c40.s100"><qs/>'And I wish it was in Jonadge's belly, I do,'<qe/> cried Mrs Gamp; appearing to confound the prophet with the whale in this miraculous aspiration.</s> </p><p pid="47" id="MC.c40.p47"><s sid="101" id="MC.c40.s101">Ruth said nothing in reply; but, as Mrs Gamp, laying her chin against the cool iron of the rail, continued to look intently at the Antwerp boat, and every now and then to give a little groan, she inquired whether any child of hers was going aboard that morning?</s> <s sid="102" id="MC.c40.s102">Or perhaps her husband, she said kindly.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c42.p2"><s sid="4" id="MC.c42.s4">It was one of those hot, silent nights, when people sit at windows listening for the thunder which they know will shortly break; when they recall dismal tales of hurricanes and earthquakes; and of lonely travellers on open plains, and lonely ships at sea, struck by lightning.</s> <s sid="5" id="MC.c42.s5">Lightning flashed and quivered on the black horizon even now; and hollow murmurings were in the wind, as though it had been blowing where the thunder rolled, and still was charged with its exhausted echoes.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c42.s6">But the storm, though gathering swiftly, had not yet come up; and the prevailing stillness was the more solemn, from the dull intelligence that seemed to hover in the air, of noise and conflict afar off.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c42.p3"><s sid="7" id="MC.c42.s7">It was very dark; but in the murky sky there were masses of cloud which shone with a lurid light, like monstrous heaps of copper that had been heated in a furnace, and were growing cold.</s> <s sid="8" id="MC.c42.s8">These had been advancing steadily and slowly, but they were now motionless, or nearly so.</s> <s sid="9" id="MC.c42.s9">As the carriage clattered round the corners of the streets, it passed at every one a knot of persons who had come there--many from their houses close at hand, without hats--to look up at that quarter of the sky.</s> <s sid="10" id="MC.c42.s10">And now a very few large drops of rain began to fall, and thunder rumbled in the distance.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="MC.c42.p8"><s sid="27" id="MC.c42.s27">Louder and louder the deep thunder rolled, as through the myriad halls of some vast temple in the sky; fiercer and brighter became the lightning, more and more heavily the rain poured down.</s> <s sid="28" id="MC.c42.s28">The horses (they were travelling now with a single pair) plunged and started from the rills of quivering fire that seemed to wind along the ground before them; but there these two men sat, and forward they went as if they were led on by an invisible attraction.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="MC.c42.p9"><s sid="29" id="MC.c42.s29">The eye, partaking of the quickness of the flashing light, saw in its every gleam a multitude of objects which it could not see at steady noon in fifty times that period.</s> <s sid="30" id="MC.c42.s30">Bells in steeples, with the rope and wheel that moved them; ragged nests of birds in cornices and nooks; faces full of consternation in the tilted waggons that came tearing past; their frightened teams ringing out a warning which the thunder drowned; harrows and ploughs left out in fields; miles upon miles of hedge-divided country, with the distant fringe of trees as obvious as the scarecrow in the bean-field close at hand; in a trembling, vivid, flickering instant, everything was clear and plain; then came a flush of red into the yellow light; a change to blue; a brightness so intense that there was nothing else but light; and then the deepest and profoundest darkness.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="MC.c42.p10"><s sid="31" id="MC.c42.s31">The lightning being very crooked and very dazzling may have presented or assisted a curious optical illusion, which suddenly rose before the startled eyes of Montague in the carriage, and as rapidly disappeared.</s> <s sid="32" id="MC.c42.s32">He thought he saw Jonas with his hand lifted, and the bottle clenched in it like a hammer, making as if he would aim a blow at his head.</s> <s sid="33" id="MC.c42.s33">At the same time he observed (or so believed) an expression in his face--a combination of the unnatural excitement he had shown all day, with a wild hatred and fear--which might have rendered a wolf a less terrible companion.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="MC.c42.p11"><s sid="34" id="MC.c42.s34">He uttered an involuntary exclamation, and called to the driver, who brought his horses to a stop with all speed.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE IN WHICH TOM PINCH AND HIS SISTER TAKE A LITTLE PLEASURE; BUT QUITE IN A DOMESTIC WAY, AND WITH NO CEREMONY ABOUT IT</title>

<p pid="1" id="MC.c45.p1"><s sid="1" id="MC.c45.s1">Tom Pinch and his sister having to part, for the dispatch of the morning's business, immediately after the dispersion of the other actors in the scene upon the wharf with which the reader has been already made acquainted, had no opportunity of discussing the subject at that time.</s> <s sid="2" id="MC.c45.s2">But Tom, in his solitary office, and Ruth, in the triangular parlour, thought about nothing else all day; and, when their hour of meeting in the afternoon approached, they were very full of it, to be sure.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c45.p2"><s sid="3" id="MC.c45.s3">There was a little plot between them, that Tom should always come out of the Temple by one way; and that was past the fountain.</s> <s sid="4" id="MC.c45.s4">Coming through Fountain Court, he was just to glance down the steps leading into Garden Court, and to look once all round him; and if Ruth had come to meet him, there he would see her; not sauntering, you understand (on account of the clerks), but coming briskly up, with the best little laugh upon her face that ever played in opposition to the fountain, and beat it all to nothing.</s> <s sid="5" id="MC.c45.s5">For, fifty to one, Tom had been looking for her in the wrong direction, and had quite given her up, while she had been tripping towards him from the first; jingling that little reticule of hers (with all the keys in it) to attract his wandering observation.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c45.p3"><s sid="6" id="MC.c45.s6">Whether there was life enough left in the slow vegetation of Fountain Court for the smoky shrubs to have any consciousness of the brightest and purest-hearted little woman in the world, is a question for gardeners, and those who are learned in the loves of plants.</s> <s sid="7" id="MC.c45.s7">But, that it was a good thing for that same paved yard to have such a delicate little figure flitting through it; that it passed like a smile from the grimy old houses, and the worn flagstones, and left them duller, darker, sterner than before; there is no sort of doubt.</s> <s sid="8" id="MC.c45.s8">The Temple fountain might have leaped up twenty feet to greet the spring of hopeful maidenhood, that in her person stole on, sparkling, through the dry and dusty channels of the Law; the chirping sparrows, bred in Temple chinks and crannies, might have held their peace to listen to imaginary skylarks, as so fresh a little creature passed; the dingy boughs, unused to droop, otherwise than in their puny growth, might have bent down in a kindred gracefulness to shed their benedictions on her graceful head; old love letters, shut up in iron boxes in the neighbouring offices, and made of no account among the heaps of family papers into which they had strayed, and of which, in their degeneracy, they formed a part, might have stirred and fluttered with a moment's recollection of their ancient tenderness, as she went lightly by.</s> <s sid="9" id="MC.c45.s9">Anything might have happened that did not happen, and never will, for the love of Ruth.</s> </p>

<p pid="133" id="MC.c48.p133"><s sid="352" id="MC.c48.s352">Apart from these considerations, Martin could not endure the thought of seeming to grasp at this unnatural charge against his relative, and using it as a stepping-stone to his grandfather's favour.</s> <s sid="353" id="MC.c48.s353">But that he would seem to do so, if he presented himself before his grandfather in Mr Pecksniff's house again, for the purpose of declaring it; and that Mr Pecksniff, of all men, would represent his conduct in that despicable light, he perfectly well knew.</s> <s sid="354" id="MC.c48.s354">On the other hand to be in possession of such a statement, and take no measures of further inquiry in reference to it, was tantamount to being a partner in the guilt it professed to disclose.</s> </p>

<p pid="134" id="MC.c48.p134"><s sid="355" id="MC.c48.s355">In a word, they were wholly unable to discover any outlet from this maze of difficulty, which did not lie through some perplexed and entangled thicket.</s> <s sid="356" id="MC.c48.s356">And although Mr Tapley was promptly taken into their confidence; and the fertile imagination of that gentleman suggested many bold expedients, which, to do him justice, he was quite ready to carry into instant operation on his own personal responsibility; still 'bating the general zeal of Mr Tapley's nature, nothing was made particularly clearer by these offers of service.</s> </p>

<p pid="135" id="MC.c48.p135"><s sid="357" id="MC.c48.s357">It was in this position of affairs that Tom's account of the strange behaviour of the decayed clerk, on the night of the tea-party, became of great moment, and finally convinced them that to arrive at a more accurate knowledge of the workings of that old man's mind and memory, would be to take a most important stride in their pursuit of the truth.</s> <s sid="358" id="MC.c48.s358">So, having first satisfied themselves that no communication had ever taken place between Lewsome and Mr Chuffey (which would have accounted at once for any suspicions the latter might entertain), they unanimously resolved that the old clerk was the man they wanted.</s> </p>

<p pid="136" id="MC.c48.p136"><s sid="359" id="MC.c48.s359">But, like the unanimous resolution of a public meeting, which will oftentimes declare that this or that grievance is not to be borne a moment longer, which is nevertheless borne for a century or two afterwards, without any modification, they only reached in this the conclusion that they were all of one mind.</s> <s sid="360" id="MC.c48.s360">For it was one thing to want Mr Chuffey, and another thing to get at him; and to do that without alarming him, or without alarming Jonas, or without being discomfited by the difficulty of striking, in an instrument so out of tune and so unused, the note they sought, was an end as far from their reach as ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="137" id="MC.c48.p137"><s sid="361" id="MC.c48.s361">The question then became, who of those about the old clerk had had most influence with him that night?</s> <s sid="362" id="MC.c48.s362">Tom said his young mistress clearly.</s> <s sid="363" id="MC.c48.s363">But Tom and all of them shrunk from the thought of entrapping her, and making her the innocent means of bringing retribution on her cruel husband.</s> <s sid="364" id="MC.c48.s364">Was there nobody else?</s> <s sid="365" id="MC.c48.s365">Why yes.</s> <s sid="366" id="MC.c48.s366">In a very different way, Tom said, he was influenced by Mrs Gamp, the nurse; who had once had the control of him, as he understood, for some time.</s> </p>

<p pid="138" id="MC.c48.p138"><s sid="367" id="MC.c48.s367">They caught at this immediately.</s> <s sid="368" id="MC.c48.s368">Here was a new way out, developed in a quarter until then overlooked.</s> <s sid="369" id="MC.c48.s369">John Westlock knew Mrs Gamp; he had given her employment; he was acquainted with her place of residence: for that good lady had obligingly furnished him, at parting, with a pack of her professional cards for general distribution.</s> <s sid="370" id="MC.c48.s370">It was decided that Mrs Gamp should be approached with caution, but approached without delay; and that the depths of that discreet matron's knowledge of Mr Chuffey, and means of bringing them, or one of them, into communication with him, should be carefully sounded.</s> </p>

<p pid="139" id="MC.c48.p139"><s sid="371" id="MC.c48.s371">On this service, Martin and John Westlock determined to proceed that night; waiting on Mrs Gamp first, at her lodgings; and taking their chance of finding her in the repose of private life, or of having to seek her out, elsewhere, in the exercise of her professional duties.</s> <s sid="372" id="MC.c48.s372">Tom returned home, that he might lose no opportunity of having an interview with Nadgett, by being absent in the event of his reappearance.</s> <s sid="373" id="MC.c48.s373">And Mr Tapley remained (by his own particular desire) for the time being in Furnival's Inn, to look after Lewsome; who might safely have been left to himself, however, for any thought he seemed to entertain of giving them the slip.</s> </p>

<p pid="140" id="MC.c48.p140"><s sid="374" id="MC.c48.s374">Before they parted on their several errands, they caused him to read aloud, in the presence of them all, the paper which he had about him, and the declaration he had attached to it, which was to the effect that he had written it voluntarily, in the fear of death and in the torture of his mind.</s> <s sid="375" id="MC.c48.s375">And when he had done so, they all signed it, and taking it from him, of his free will, locked it in a place of safety.</s> </p>

<p pid="141" id="MC.c48.p141"><s sid="376" id="MC.c48.s376">Martin also wrote, by John's advice, a letter to the trustees of the famous Grammar School, boldly claiming the successful design as his, and charging Mr Pecksniff with the fraud he had committed.</s> <s sid="377" id="MC.c48.s377">In this proceeding also, John was hotly interested; observing, with his usual irreverance, that Mr Pecksniff had been a successful rascal all his life through, and that it would be a lasting source of happiness to him (John) if he could help to do him justice in the smallest particular.</s> </p>

<p pid="142" id="MC.c48.p142"><s sid="378" id="MC.c48.s378">A busy day!</s> <s sid="379" id="MC.c48.s379">But Martin had no lodgings yet; so when these matters were disposed of, he excused himself from dining with John Westlock and was fain to wander out alone, and look for some.</s> <s sid="380" id="MC.c48.s380">He succeeded, after great trouble, in engaging two garrets for himself and Mark, situated in a court in the Strand, not far from Temple Bar.</s> <s sid="381" id="MC.c48.s381">Their luggage, which was waiting for them at a coach-office, he conveyed to this new place of refuge; and it was with a glow of satisfaction, which as a selfish man he never could have known and never had, that, thinking how much pains and trouble he had saved Mark, and how pleased and astonished Mark would be, he afterwards walked up and down, in the Temple, eating a meat-pie for his dinner.</s> </p></div>

<title>CHAPTER FORTY-NINE IN WHICH MRS HARRIS ASSISTED BY A TEAPOT, IS THE CAUSE OF A DIVISION BETWEEN FRIENDS</title>

<p pid="1" id="MC.c49.p1"><s sid="1" id="MC.c49.s1">Mrs Gamp's apartment in Kingsgate Street, High Holborn, wore, metaphorically speaking, a robe of state.</s> <s sid="2" id="MC.c49.s2">It was swept and garnished for the reception of a visitor.</s> <s sid="3" id="MC.c49.s3">That visitor was Betsey Prig; Mrs Prig, of Bartlemy's; or as some said Barklemy's, or as some said Bardlemy's; for by all these endearing and familiar appellations, had the hospital of Saint Bartholomew become a household word among the sisterhood which Betsey Prig adorned.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c49.p2"><s sid="4" id="MC.c49.s4">Mrs Gamp's apartment was not a spacious one, but, to a contented mind, a closet is a palace; and the first-floor front at Mr Sweedlepipe's may have been, in the imagination of Mrs Gamp, a stately pile.</s> <s sid="5" id="MC.c49.s5">If it were not exactly that, to restless intellects, it at least comprised as much accommodation as any person, not sanguine to insanity, could have looked for in a room of its dimensions.</s> <s sid="6" id="MC.c49.s6">For only keep the bedstead always in your mind; and you were safe.</s> <s sid="7" id="MC.c49.s7">That was the grand secret.</s> <s sid="8" id="MC.c49.s8">Remembering the bedstead, you might even stoop to look under the little round table for anything you had dropped, without hurting yourself much against the chest of drawers, or qualifying as a patient of Saint Bartholomew, by falling into the fire.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c49.p3"><s sid="9" id="MC.c49.s9">Visitors were much assisted in their cautious efforts to preserve an unflagging recollection of this piece of furniture, by its size; which was great.</s> <s sid="10" id="MC.c49.s10">It was not a turn-up bedstead, nor yet a French bedstead, nor yet a four-post bedstead, but what is poetically called a tent; the sacking whereof was low and bulgy, insomuch that Mrs Gamp's box would not go under it, but stopped half-way, in a manner which, while it did violence to the reason, likewise endangered the legs of a stranger.</s> <s sid="11" id="MC.c49.s11">The frame too, which would have supported the canopy and hangings if there had been any, was ornamented with divers pippins carved in timber, which on the slightest provocation, and frequently on none at all, came tumbling down; harassing the peaceful guest with inexplicable terrors.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="MC.c49.p4" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="MC.c49.s12">The bed itself was decorated with a patchwork quilt of great antiquity; and at the upper end, upon the side nearest to the door, hung a scanty curtain of blue check, which prevented the Zephyrs that were abroad in Kingsgate Street, from visiting Mrs Gamp's head too roughly.</s> <s sid="13" id="MC.c49.s13">Some rusty gowns and other articles of that lady's wardrobe depended from the posts; and these had so adapted themselves by long usage to her figure, that more than one impatient husband coming in precipitately, at about the time of twilight, had been for an instant stricken dumb by the supposed discovery that Mrs Gamp had hanged herself.</s> <s sid="14" id="MC.c49.s14">One gentleman, coming on the usual hasty errand, had said indeed, that they looked like guardian angels <qs/>'watching of her in her sleep.'<qe/></s> <s sid="15" id="MC.c49.s15">But that, as Mrs Gamp said, <qs/>'was his first;'<qe/> and he never repeated the sentiment, though he often repeated his visit.</s> </p><p pid="5" id="MC.c49.p5"><s sid="16" id="MC.c49.s16">The chairs in Mrs Gamp's apartment were extremely large and broad- backed, which was more than a sufficient reason for there being but two in number.</s> <s sid="17" id="MC.c49.s17">They were both elbow-chairs, of ancient mahogany; and were chiefly valuable for the slippery nature of their seats, which had been originally horsehair, but were now covered with a shiny substance of a bluish tint, from which the visitor began to slide away with a dismayed countenance, immediately after sitting down.</s> <s sid="18" id="MC.c49.s18">What Mrs Gamp wanted in chairs she made up in bandboxes; of which she had a great collection, devoted to the reception of various miscellaneous valuables, which were not, however, as well protected as the good woman, by a pleasant fiction, seemed to think; for, though every bandbox had a carefully closed lid, not one among them had a bottom; owing to which cause the property within was merely, as it were, extinguished.</s> <s sid="19" id="MC.c49.s19">The chest of drawers having been originally made to stand upon the top of another chest, had a dwarfish, elfin look, alone; but in regard of its security it had a great advantage over the bandboxes, for as all the handles had been long ago pulled off, it was very difficult to get at its contents.</s> <s sid="20" id="MC.c49.s20">This indeed was only to be done by one or two devices; either by tilting the whole structure forward until all the drawers fell out together, or by opening them singly with knives, like oysters.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="MC.c49.p6"><s sid="21" id="MC.c49.s21">Mrs Gamp stored all her household matters in a little cupboard by the fire-place; beginning below the surface (as in nature) with the coals, and mounting gradually upwards to the spirits, which, from motives of delicacy, she kept in a teapot.</s> <s sid="22" id="MC.c49.s22">The chimney-piece was ornamented with a small almanack, marked here and there in Mrs Gamp's own hand with a memorandum of the date at which some lady was expected to fall due.</s> <s sid="23" id="MC.c49.s23">It was also embellished with three profiles: one, in colours, of Mrs Gamp herself in early life; one, in bronze, of a lady in feathers, supposed to be Mrs Harris, as she appeared when dressed for a ball; and one, in black, of Mr Gamp, deceased.</s> <s sid="24" id="MC.c49.s24">The last was a full length, in order that the likeness might be rendered more obvious and forcible by the introduction of the wooden leg.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="MC.c49.p7"><s sid="25" id="MC.c49.s25">A pair of bellows, a pair of pattens, a toasting-fork, a kettle, a pap-boat, a spoon for the administration of medicine to the refractory, and lastly, Mrs Gamp's umbrella, which as something of great price and rarity, was displayed with particular ostentation, completed the decorations of the chimney-piece and adjacent wall.</s> <s sid="26" id="MC.c49.s26">Towards these objects Mrs Gamp raised her eyes in satisfaction when she had arranged the tea-board, and had concluded her arrangements for the reception of Betsey Prig, even unto the setting forth of two pounds of Newcastle salmon, intensely pickled.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO IN WHICH THE TABLES ARE TURNED, COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN</title>

<p pid="1" id="MC.c52.p1"><s sid="1" id="MC.c52.s1">Old Martin's cherished projects, so long hidden in his own breast, so frequently in danger of abrupt disclosure through the bursting forth of the indignation he had hoarded up during his residence with Mr Pecksniff, were retarded, but not beyond a few hours, by the occurrences just now related.</s> <s sid="2" id="MC.c52.s2">Stunned, as he had been at first by the intelligence conveyed to him through Tom Pinch and John Westlock, of the supposed manner of his brother's death; overwhelmed as he was by the subsequent narratives of Chuffey and Nadgett, and the forging of that chain of circumstances ending in the death of Jonas, of which catastrophe he was immediately informed; scattered as his purposes and hopes were for the moment, by the crowding in of all these incidents between him and his end; still their very intensity and the tumult of their assemblage nerved him to the rapid and unyielding execution of his scheme.</s> <s sid="3" id="MC.c52.s3">In every single circumstance, whether it were cruel, cowardly, or false, he saw the flowering of the same pregnant seed.</s> <s sid="4" id="MC.c52.s4">Self; grasping, eager, narrow- ranging, overreaching self; with its long train of suspicions, lusts, deceits, and all their growing consequences; was the root of the vile tree.</s> <s sid="5" id="MC.c52.s5">Mr Pecksniff had so presented his character before the old man's eyes, that he--the good, the tolerant, enduring Pecksniff--had become the incarnation of all selfishness and treachery; and the more odious the shapes in which those vices ranged themselves before him now, the sterner consolation he had in his design of setting Mr Pecksniff right and Mr Pecksniff's victims too.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="MC.c52.p2"><s sid="6" id="MC.c52.s6">To this work he brought, not only the energy and determination natural to his character (which, as the reader may have observed in the beginning of his or her acquaintance with this gentleman, was remarkable for the strong development of those qualities), but all the forced and unnaturally nurtured energy consequent upon their long suppression.</s> <s sid="7" id="MC.c52.s7">And these two tides of resolution setting into one and sweeping on, became so strong and vigorous, that, to prevent themselves from being carried away before it, Heaven knows where, was as much as John Westlock and Mark Tapley together (though they were tolerably energetic too) could manage to effect.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="MC.c52.p3"><s sid="8" id="MC.c52.s8">He had sent for John Westlock immediately on his arrival; and John, under the conduct of Tom Pinch, had waited on him.</s> <s sid="9" id="MC.c52.s9">Having a lively recollection of Mr Tapley, he had caused that gentleman's attendance to be secured, through John's means, without delay; and thus, as we have seen, they had all repaired together to the City.</s> <s sid="10" id="MC.c52.s10">But his grandson he had refused to see until to-morrow, when Mr Tapley was instructed to summon him to the Temple at ten o'clock in the forenoon.</s> <s sid="11" id="MC.c52.s11">Tom he would not allow to be employed in anything, lest he should be wrongfully suspected; but he was a party to all their proceedings, and was with them until late at night--until after they knew of the death of Jonas; when he went home to tell all these wonders to little Ruth, and to prepare her for accompanying him to the Temple in the morning, agreeably to Mr Chuzzlewit's particular injunction.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="MC.c52.p4"><s sid="12" id="MC.c52.s12">It was characteristic of old Martin, and his looking on to something which he had distinctly before him, that he communicated to them nothing of his intentions, beyond such hints of reprisal on Mr Pecksniff as they gathered from the game he had played in that gentleman's house, and the brightening of his eyes whenever his name was mentioned.</s> <s sid="13" id="MC.c52.s13">Even to John Westlock, in whom he was evidently disposed to place great confidence (which may indeed be said of every one of them), he gave no explanation whatever.</s> <s sid="14" id="MC.c52.s14">He merely requested him to return in the morning; and with this for their utmost satisfaction, they left him, when the night was far advanced, alone.</s> </p>
