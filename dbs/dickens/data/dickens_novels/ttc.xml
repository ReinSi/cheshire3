<title>I The Period</title>

<p pid="1" id="TTC.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="TTC.c1.s1">It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way--in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="TTC.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="TTC.c1.s2">There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France.</s> <s sid="3" id="TTC.c1.s3">In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="TTC.c1.p3"><s sid="4" id="TTC.c1.s4">It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.</s> <s sid="5" id="TTC.c1.s5">Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this.</s> <s sid="6" id="TTC.c1.s6">Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster.</s> <s sid="7" id="TTC.c1.s7">Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs.</s> <s sid="8" id="TTC.c1.s8">Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America:  which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="TTC.c1.p4"><s sid="9" id="TTC.c1.s9">France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it.</s> <s sid="10" id="TTC.c1.s10">Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards.</s> <s sid="11" id="TTC.c1.s11">It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history.</s> <s sid="12" id="TTC.c1.s12">It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution.</s> <s sid="13" id="TTC.c1.s13">But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread:  the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="TTC.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="TTC.c1.s14">In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting.</s> <s sid="15" id="TTC.c1.s15">Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow- tradesman whom he stopped in his character of <qs/>"the Captain,"<qe/><sls/> gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, <sle/><qs/>"in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:"<qe/> after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St.</s> <s sid="16" id="TTC.c1.s16">Giles's, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way.</s> <s sid="17" id="TTC.c1.s17">In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of sixpence.</s> </p><p pid="6" id="TTC.c1.p6"><s sid="18" id="TTC.c1.s18">All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.</s> <s sid="19" id="TTC.c1.s19">Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand.</s> <s sid="20" id="TTC.c1.s20">Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the roads that lay before them.</s> </p></div>

<title>II The Mail</title>

<p pid="1" id="TTC.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="TTC.c2.s1">It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business.</s> <s sid="2" id="TTC.c2.s2">The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter's Hill.</s> <s sid="3" id="TTC.c2.s3">He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath.</s> <s sid="4" id="TTC.c2.s4">Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="TTC.c2.p2" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="TTC.c2.s5">With drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through the thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were falling to pieces at the larger joints.</s> <s sid="6" id="TTC.c2.s6">As often as the driver rested them and brought them to a stand, with a wary <qs/>"Wo-ho! so-ho-then!"<qe/> the near leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an unusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the hill.</s> <s sid="7" id="TTC.c2.s7">Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a nervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="TTC.c2.p3"><s sid="8" id="TTC.c2.s8">There was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its forlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding none.</s> <s sid="9" id="TTC.c2.s9">A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the air in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the waves of an unwholesome sea might do.</s> <s sid="10" id="TTC.c2.s10">It was dense enough to shut out everything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings, and a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed into it, as if they had made it all.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="TTC.c2.p4"><s sid="11" id="TTC.c2.s11">Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail.</s> <s sid="12" id="TTC.c2.s12">All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots.</s> <s sid="13" id="TTC.c2.s13">Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions.</s> <s sid="14" id="TTC.c2.s14">In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers.</s> <s sid="15" id="TTC.c2.s15">As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in "the Captain's" pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards.</s> <s sid="16" id="TTC.c2.s16">So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="TTC.c2.p5"><s sid="17" id="TTC.c2.s17">The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="TTC.c2.p6" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="TTC.c2.s18"><qs/>"Wo-ho!"<qe/> said the coachman.</s> <s sid="19" id="TTC.c2.s19"><qs/>"So, then!</s> <s sid="20" id="TTC.c2.s20">One more pull and you're at the top and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to it!--Joe!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="7" id="TTC.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="TTC.c2.s21"><qs/>"Halloa!"<qe/> the guard replied.</s> </p><p pid="8" id="TTC.c2.p8" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="TTC.c2.s22"><qs/>"What o'clock do you make it, Joe?"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="9" id="TTC.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="TTC.c2.s23"><qs/>"Ten minutes, good, past eleven."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="10" id="TTC.c2.p10" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="TTC.c2.s24"><qs/>"My blood!"<qe/><sss/> ejaculated the vexed coachman, <sse/><qs/>"and not atop of Shooter's yet!</s> <s sid="25" id="TTC.c2.s25">Tst!</s> <s sid="26" id="TTC.c2.s26">Yah!</s> <s sid="27" id="TTC.c2.s27">Get on with you!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="TTC.c2.p11"><s sid="28" id="TTC.c2.s28">The emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative, made a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed suit.</s> <s sid="29" id="TTC.c2.s29">Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its passengers squashing along by its side.</s> <s sid="30" id="TTC.c2.s30">They had stopped when the coach stopped, and they kept close company with it.</s> <s sid="31" id="TTC.c2.s31">If any one of the three had had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead into the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of getting shot instantly as a highwayman.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="TTC.c2.p12"><s sid="32" id="TTC.c2.s32">The last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill.</s> <s sid="33" id="TTC.c2.s33">The horses stopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for the descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="TTC.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="TTC.c2.s34"><qs/>"Tst!</s> <s sid="35" id="TTC.c2.s35">Joe!"<qe/> cried the coachman in a warning voice, looking down from his box.</s> </p><p pid="14" id="TTC.c2.p14" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="TTC.c2.s36"><qs/>"What do you say, Tom?"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="TTC.c2.p15"><s sid="37" id="TTC.c2.s37">They both listened.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="TTC.c2.p16" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="TTC.c2.s38"><qs/>"I say a horse at a canter coming up, Joe."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="17" id="TTC.c2.p17" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="TTC.c2.s39"><qs/>"_I_ say a horse at a gallop, Tom,"<qe/> returned the guard, leaving his hold of the door, and mounting nimbly to his place.</s> <s sid="40" id="TTC.c2.s40"><qs/>"Gentlemen!</s> <s sid="41" id="TTC.c2.s41">In the king's name, all of you!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="18" id="TTC.c2.p18"><s sid="42" id="TTC.c2.s42">With this hurried adjuration, he cocked his blunderbuss, and stood on the offensive.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="TTC.c2.p19"><s sid="43" id="TTC.c2.s43">The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow.</s> <s sid="44" id="TTC.c2.s44">He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained in the road below him.</s> <s sid="45" id="TTC.c2.s45">They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened.</s> <s sid="46" id="TTC.c2.s46">The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="TTC.c2.p20"><s sid="47" id="TTC.c2.s47">The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed.</s> <s sid="48" id="TTC.c2.s48">The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation.</s> <s sid="49" id="TTC.c2.s49">The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="TTC.c2.p21"><s sid="50" id="TTC.c2.s50">The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="TTC.c2.p22" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="TTC.c2.s51"><qs/>"So-ho!"<qe/> the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar.</s> <s sid="52" id="TTC.c2.s52"><qs/>"Yo there!</s> <s sid="53" id="TTC.c2.s53">Stand!</s> <s sid="54" id="TTC.c2.s54">I shall fire!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="TTC.c2.p23" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="TTC.c2.s55">The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man's voice called from the mist, <qs/>"Is that the Dover mail?"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="24" id="TTC.c2.p24" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="TTC.c2.s56"><qs/>"Never you mind what it is!"<qe/> the guard retorted.</s> <s sid="57" id="TTC.c2.s57"><qs/>"What are you?"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="TTC.c2.p25" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="TTC.c2.s58"><qs/>"_Is_ that the Dover mail?"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="26" id="TTC.c2.p26" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="TTC.c2.s59"><qs/>"Why do you want to know?"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="27" id="TTC.c2.p27" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="TTC.c2.s60"><qs/>"I want a passenger, if it is."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="28" id="TTC.c2.p28" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="TTC.c2.s61"><qs/>"What passenger?"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="29" id="TTC.c2.p29" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="TTC.c2.s62"><qs/>"Mr. Jarvis Lorry."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="30" id="TTC.c2.p30"><s sid="63" id="TTC.c2.s63">Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name.</s> <s sid="64" id="TTC.c2.s64">The guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="TTC.c7.p1"><s sid="1" id="TTC.c7.s1">Tellson's Bank by Temple Bar was an old-fashioned place, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty.</s> <s sid="2" id="TTC.c7.s2">It was very small, very dark, very ugly, very incommodious.</s> <s sid="3" id="TTC.c7.s3">It was an old-fashioned place, moreover, in the moral attribute that the partners in the House were proud of its smallness, proud of its darkness, proud of its ugliness, proud of its incommodiousness.</s> <s sid="4" id="TTC.c7.s4">They were even boastful of its eminence in those particulars, and were fired by an express conviction that, if it were less objectionable, it would be less respectable.</s> <s sid="5" id="TTC.c7.s5">This was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business.</s> <s sid="6" id="TTC.c7.s6">Tellson's (they said) wanted no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no embellishment.</s> <s sid="7" id="TTC.c7.s7">Noakes and Co.'s might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but Tellson's, thank Heaven!--</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="TTC.c7.p2"><s sid="8" id="TTC.c7.s8">Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellson's.</s> <s sid="9" id="TTC.c7.s9">In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="TTC.c7.p3" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="TTC.c7.s10">Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience.</s> <s sid="11" id="TTC.c7.s11">After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps, and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar.</s> <s sid="12" id="TTC.c7.s12">If your business necessitated your seeing <qs/>"the House,"<qe/> you were put into a species of Condemned Hold at the back, where you meditated on a misspent life, until the House came with its hands in its pockets, and you could hardly blink at it in the dismal twilight.</s> <s sid="13" id="TTC.c7.s13">Your money came out of, or went into, wormy old wooden drawers, particles of which flew up your nose and down your throat when they were opened and shut.</s> <s sid="14" id="TTC.c7.s14">Your bank-notes had a musty odour, as if they were fast decomposing into rags again.</s> <s sid="15" id="TTC.c7.s15">Your plate was stowed away among the neighbouring cesspools, and evil communications corrupted its good polish in a day or two.</s> <s sid="16" id="TTC.c7.s16">Your deeds got into extemporised strong-rooms made of kitchens and sculleries, and fretted all the fat out of their parchments into the banking-house air.</s> <s sid="17" id="TTC.c7.s17">Your lighter boxes of family papers went up-stairs into a Barmecide room, that always had a great dining-table in it and never had a dinner, and where, even in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty, the first letters written to you by your old love, or by your little children, were but newly released from the horror of being ogled through the windows, by the heads exposed on Temple Bar with an insensate brutality and ferocity worthy of Abyssinia or Ashantee.</s> </p><p pid="4" id="TTC.c7.p4"><s sid="18" id="TTC.c7.s18">But indeed, at that time, putting to death was a recipe much in vogue with all trades and professions, and not least of all with Tellson's.</s> <s sid="19" id="TTC.c7.s19">Death is Nature's remedy for all things, and why not Legislation's?</s> <s sid="20" id="TTC.c7.s20">Accordingly, the forger was put to Death; the utterer of a bad note was put to Death; the unlawful opener of a letter was put to Death; the purloiner of forty shillings and sixpence was put to Death; the holder of a horse at Tellson's door, who made off with it, was put to Death; the coiner of a bad shilling was put to Death; the sounders of three-fourths of the notes in the whole gamut of Crime, were put to Death.</s> <s sid="21" id="TTC.c7.s21">Not that it did the least good in the way of prevention--it might almost have been worth remarking that the fact was exactly the reverse--but, it cleared off (as to this world) the trouble of each particular case, and left nothing else connected with it to be looked after.</s> <s sid="22" id="TTC.c7.s22">Thus, Tellson's, in its day, like greater places of business, its contemporaries, had taken so many lives, that, if the heads laid low before it had been ranged on Temple Bar instead of being privately disposed of, they would probably have excluded what little light the ground floor had, in a rather significant manner.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="TTC.c7.p5"><s sid="23" id="TTC.c7.s23">Cramped in all kinds of dun cupboards and hutches at Tellson's, the oldest of men carried on the business gravely.</s> <s sid="24" id="TTC.c7.s24">When they took a young man into Tellson's London house, they hid him somewhere till he was old.</s> <s sid="25" id="TTC.c7.s25">They kept him in a dark place, like a cheese, until he had the full Tellson flavour and blue-mould upon him.</s> <s sid="26" id="TTC.c7.s26">Then only was he permitted to be seen, spectacularly poring over large books, and casting his breeches and gaiters into the general weight of the establishment.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="TTC.c7.p6"><s sid="27" id="TTC.c7.s27">Outside Tellson's--never by any means in it, unless called in--was an odd-job-man, an occasional porter and messenger, who served as the live sign of the house.</s> <s sid="28" id="TTC.c7.s28">He was never absent during business hours, unless upon an errand, and then he was represented by his son:  a grisly urchin of twelve, who was his express image.</s> <s sid="29" id="TTC.c7.s29">People understood that Tellson's, in a stately way, tolerated the odd-job-man.</s> <s sid="30" id="TTC.c7.s30">The house had always tolerated some person in that capacity, and time and tide had drifted this person to the post.</s> <s sid="31" id="TTC.c7.s31">His surname was Cruncher, and on the youthful occasion of his renouncing by proxy the works of darkness, in the easterly parish church of Hounsditch, he had received the added appellation of Jerry.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="TTC.c7.p7"><s sid="32" id="TTC.c7.s32">The scene was Mr. Cruncher's private lodging in Hanging-sword-alley, Whitefriars:  the time, half-past seven of the clock on a windy March morning, Anno Domini seventeen hundred and eighty.</s> <s sid="33" id="TTC.c7.s33">(Mr.</s> <s sid="34" id="TTC.c7.s34">Cruncher himself always spoke of the year of our Lord as Anna Dominoes: apparently under the impression that the Christian era dated from the invention of a popular game, by a lady who had bestowed her name upon it.)</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="TTC.c7.p8"><s sid="35" id="TTC.c7.s35">Mr. Cruncher's apartments were not in a savoury neighbourhood, and were but two in number, even if a closet with a single pane of glass in it might be counted as one.</s> <s sid="36" id="TTC.c7.s36">But they were very decently kept.</s> <s sid="37" id="TTC.c7.s37">Early as it was, on the windy March morning, the room in which he lay abed was already scrubbed throughout; and between the cups and saucers arranged for breakfast, and the lumbering deal table, a very clean white cloth was spread.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="TTC.c7.p9"><s sid="38" id="TTC.c7.s38">Mr. Cruncher reposed under a patchwork counterpane, like a Harlequin at home.</s> <s sid="39" id="TTC.c7.s39">At first, he slept heavily, but, by degrees, began to roll and surge in bed, until he rose above the surface, with his spiky hair looking as if it must tear the sheets to ribbons.</s> <s sid="40" id="TTC.c7.s40">At which juncture, he exclaimed, in a voice of dire exasperation:</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="TTC.c8.p40"><s sid="74" id="TTC.c8.s74">Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling, stared at him.</s> <s sid="75" id="TTC.c8.s75">All the human breath in the place, rolled at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire.</s> <s sid="76" id="TTC.c8.s76">Eager faces strained round pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court, laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help themselves, at anybody's cost, to a view of him--stood a-tiptoe, got upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him.</s> <s sid="77" id="TTC.c8.s77">Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate, Jerry stood:  aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not, that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="TTC.c8.p41"><s sid="78" id="TTC.c8.s78">The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye.</s> <s sid="79" id="TTC.c8.s79">His condition was that of a young gentleman.</s> <s sid="80" id="TTC.c8.s80">He was plainly dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out of his way than for ornament.</s> <s sid="81" id="TTC.c8.s81">As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the soul to be stronger than the sun.</s> <s sid="82" id="TTC.c8.s82">He was otherwise quite self-possessed, bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="TTC.c8.p42"><s sid="83" id="TTC.c8.s83">The sort of interest with which this man was stared and breathed at, was not a sort that elevated humanity.</s> <s sid="84" id="TTC.c8.s84">Had he stood in peril of a less horrible sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his fascination.</s> <s sid="85" id="TTC.c8.s85">The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled, was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder, yielded the sensation.</s> <s sid="86" id="TTC.c8.s86">Whatever gloss the various spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, Ogreish.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="TTC.c8.p44"><s sid="90" id="TTC.c8.s90">The accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged, beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it.</s> <s sid="91" id="TTC.c8.s91">He was quiet and attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest; and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so composedly, that they had not displaced a leaf of the herbs with which it was strewn.</s> <s sid="92" id="TTC.c8.s92">The court was all bestrewn with herbs and sprinkled with vinegar, as a precaution against gaol air and gaol fever.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="TTC.c8.p45"><s sid="93" id="TTC.c8.s93">Over the prisoner's head there was a mirror, to throw the light down upon him.</s> <s sid="94" id="TTC.c8.s94">Crowds of the wicked and the wretched had been reflected in it, and had passed from its surface and this earth's together.</s> <s sid="95" id="TTC.c8.s95">Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one day to give up its dead.</s> <s sid="96" id="TTC.c8.s96">Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner's mind.</s> <s sid="97" id="TTC.c8.s97">Be that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="TTC.c8.p46"><s sid="98" id="TTC.c8.s98">It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left.</s> <s sid="99" id="TTC.c8.s99">About on a level with his eyes, there sat, in that corner of the Judge's bench, two persons upon whom his look immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="TTC.c8.p47"><s sid="100" id="TTC.c8.s100">The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face:  not of an active kind, but pondering and self-communing.</s> <s sid="101" id="TTC.c8.s101">When this expression was upon him, he looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up--as it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter--he became a handsome man, not past the prime of life.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="TTC.c9.p1"><s sid="1" id="TTC.c9.s1">Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life.</s> <s sid="2" id="TTC.c9.s2">That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before.</s> <s sid="3" id="TTC.c9.s3">That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account.</s> <s sid="4" id="TTC.c9.s4">That, if it were in the nature of traitorous ways to thrive (which happily it never was), the real wickedness and guilt of his business might have remained undiscovered.</s> <s sid="5" id="TTC.c9.s5">That Providence, however, had put it into the heart of a person who was beyond fear and beyond reproach, to ferret out the nature of the prisoner's schemes, and, struck with horror, to disclose them to his Majesty's Chief Secretary of State and most honourable Privy Council.</s> <s sid="6" id="TTC.c9.s6">That, this patriot would be produced before them.</s> <s sid="7" id="TTC.c9.s7">That, his position and attitude were, on the whole, sublime.</s> <s sid="8" id="TTC.c9.s8">That, he had been the prisoner's friend, but, at once in an auspicious and an evil hour detecting his infamy, had resolved to immolate the traitor he could no longer cherish in his bosom, on the sacred altar of his country.</s> <s sid="9" id="TTC.c9.s9">That, if statues were decreed in Britain, as in ancient Greece and Rome, to public benefactors, this shining citizen would assuredly have had one.</s> <s sid="10" id="TTC.c9.s10">That, as they were not so decreed, he probably would not have one.</s> <s sid="11" id="TTC.c9.s11">That, Virtue, as had been observed by the poets (in many passages which he well knew the jury would have, word for word, at the tips of their tongues; whereat the jury's countenances displayed a guilty consciousness that they knew nothing about the passages), was in a manner contagious; more especially the bright virtue known as patriotism, or love of country.</s> <s sid="12" id="TTC.c9.s12">That, the lofty example of this immaculate and unimpeachable witness for the Crown, to refer to whom however unworthily was an honour, had communicated itself to the prisoner's servant, and had engendered in him a holy determination to examine his master's table-drawers and pockets, and secrete his papers.</s> <s sid="13" id="TTC.c9.s13">That, he (Mr.</s> <s sid="14" id="TTC.c9.s14">Attorney-General) was prepared to hear some disparagement attempted of this admirable servant; but that, in a general way, he preferred him to his (Mr.</s> <s sid="15" id="TTC.c9.s15">Attorney-General's) brothers and sisters, and honoured him more than his (Mr.</s> <s sid="16" id="TTC.c9.s16">Attorney-General's) father and mother.</s> <s sid="17" id="TTC.c9.s17">That, he called with confidence on the jury to come and do likewise.</s> <s sid="18" id="TTC.c9.s18">That, the evidence of these two witnesses, coupled with the documents of their discovering that would be produced, would show the prisoner to have been furnished with lists of his Majesty's forces, and of their disposition and preparation, both by sea and land, and would leave no doubt that he had habitually conveyed such information to a hostile power.</s> <s sid="19" id="TTC.c9.s19">That, these lists could not be proved to be in the prisoner's handwriting; but that it was all the same; that, indeed, it was rather the better for the prosecution, as showing the prisoner to be artful in his precautions.</s> <s sid="20" id="TTC.c9.s20">That, the proof would go back five years, and would show the prisoner already engaged in these pernicious missions, within a few weeks before the date of the very first action fought between the British troops and the Americans.</s> <s sid="21" id="TTC.c9.s21">That, for these reasons, the jury, being a loyal jury (as he knew they were), and being a responsible jury (as _they_ knew they were), must positively find the prisoner Guilty, and make an end of him, whether they liked it or not.</s> <s sid="22" id="TTC.c9.s22">That, they never could lay their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could tolerate the idea of their wives laying their heads upon their pillows; that, they never could endure the notion of their children laying their heads upon their pillows; in short, that there never more could be, for them or theirs, any laying of heads upon pillows at all, unless the prisoner's head was taken off.</s> <s sid="23" id="TTC.c9.s23">That head Mr. Attorney-General concluded by demanding of them, in the name of everything he could think of with a round turn in it, and on the faith of his solemn asseveration that he already considered the prisoner as good as dead and gone.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="TTC.c9.p2"><s sid="24" id="TTC.c9.s24">When the Attorney-General ceased, a buzz arose in the court as if a cloud of great blue-flies were swarming about the prisoner, in anticipation of what he was soon to become.</s> <s sid="25" id="TTC.c9.s25">When toned down again, the unimpeachable patriot appeared in the witness-box.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="TTC.c9.p3"><s sid="26" id="TTC.c9.s26">Mr. Solicitor-General then, following his leader's lead, examined the patriot:</s> <s sid="27" id="TTC.c9.s27">John Barsad, gentleman, by name.</s> <s sid="28" id="TTC.c9.s28">The story of his pure soul was exactly what Mr. Attorney-General had described it to be-- perhaps, if it had a fault, a little too exactly.</s> <s sid="29" id="TTC.c9.s29">Having released his noble bosom of its burden, he would have modestly withdrawn himself, but that the wigged gentleman with the papers before him, sitting not far from Mr. Lorry, begged to ask him a few questions.</s> <s sid="30" id="TTC.c9.s30">The wigged gentleman sitting opposite, still looking at the ceiling of the court.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="TTC.c12.p1"><s sid="1" id="TTC.c12.s1">The quiet lodgings of Doctor Manette were in a quiet street-corner not far from Soho-square.</s> <s sid="2" id="TTC.c12.s2">On the afternoon of a certain fine Sunday when the waves of four months had roiled over the trial for treason, and carried it, as to the public interest and memory, far out to sea, Mr. Jarvis Lorry walked along the sunny streets from Clerkenwell where he lived, on his way to dine with the Doctor.</s> <s sid="3" id="TTC.c12.s3">After several relapses into business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="TTC.c12.p2"><s sid="4" id="TTC.c12.s4">On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in the afternoon, for three reasons of habit.</s> <s sid="5" id="TTC.c12.s5">Firstly, because, on fine Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie; secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="TTC.c12.p3"><s sid="6" id="TTC.c12.s6">A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be found in London.</s> <s sid="7" id="TTC.c12.s7">There was no way through it, and the front windows of the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it.</s> <s sid="8" id="TTC.c12.s8">There were few buildings then, north of the Oxford-road, and forest-trees flourished, and wild flowers grew, and the hawthorn blossomed, in the now vanished fields.</s> <s sid="9" id="TTC.c12.s9">As a consequence, country airs circulated in Soho with vigorous freedom, instead of languishing into the parish like stray paupers without a settlement; and there was many a good south wall, not far off, on which the peaches ripened in their season.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="TTC.c12.p4"><s sid="10" id="TTC.c12.s10">The summer light struck into the corner brilliantly in the earlier part of the day; but, when the streets grew hot, the corner was in shadow, though not in shadow so remote but that you could see beyond it into a glare of brightness.</s> <s sid="11" id="TTC.c12.s11">It was a cool spot, staid but cheerful, a wonderful place for echoes, and a very harbour from the raging streets.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="TTC.c25.p1"><s sid="1" id="TTC.c25.s1">Worn out by anxious watching, Mr. Lorry fell asleep at his post.</s> <s sid="2" id="TTC.c25.s2">On the tenth morning of his suspense, he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="TTC.c25.p2"><s sid="3" id="TTC.c25.s3">He rubbed his eyes and roused himself; but he doubted, when he had done so, whether he was not still asleep.</s> <s sid="4" id="TTC.c25.s4">For, going to the door of the Doctor's room and looking in, he perceived that the shoemaker's bench and tools were put aside again, and that the Doctor himself sat reading at the window.</s> <s sid="5" id="TTC.c25.s5">He was in his usual morning dress, and his face (which Mr. Lorry could distinctly see), though still very pale, was calmly studious and attentive.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="TTC.c25.p3"><s sid="6" id="TTC.c25.s6">Even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake, Mr. Lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own; for, did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect, and employed as usual; and was there any sign within their range, that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened?</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="TTC.c25.p4"><s sid="7" id="TTC.c25.s7">It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the answer being obvious.</s> <s sid="8" id="TTC.c25.s8">If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there?</s> <s sid="9" id="TTC.c25.s9">How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning?</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="TTC.c25.p5"><s sid="10" id="TTC.c25.s10">Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side.</s> <s sid="11" id="TTC.c25.s11">If he had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.</s> <s sid="12" id="TTC.c25.s12">He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred.</s> <s sid="13" id="TTC.c25.s13">If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr. Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="TTC.c25.p6"><s sid="14" id="TTC.c25.s14">Miss Pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked out with care.</s> <s sid="15" id="TTC.c25.s15">Having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette, Mr. Lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual white linen, and with his usual neat leg.</s> <s sid="16" id="TTC.c25.s16">The Doctor was summoned in the usual way, and came to breakfast.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="TTC.c25.p7"><s sid="17" id="TTC.c25.s17">So far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which Mr. Lorry felt to be the only safe advance, he at first supposed that his daughter's marriage had taken place yesterday.</s> <s sid="18" id="TTC.c25.s18">An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and counting, and evidently made him uneasy.</s> <s sid="19" id="TTC.c25.s19">In all other respects, however, he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid he sought.</s> <s sid="20" id="TTC.c25.s20">And that aid was his own.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="TTC.c29.p1"><s sid="1" id="TTC.c29.s1">There was a change on the village where the fountain fell, and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together.</s> <s sid="2" id="TTC.c29.s2">The prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore; there were soldiers to guard it, but not many; there were officers to guard the soldiers, but not one of them knew what his men would do--beyond this:  that it would probably not be what he was ordered.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="TTC.c29.p2"><s sid="3" id="TTC.c29.s3">Far and wide lay a ruined country, yielding nothing but desolation.</s> <s sid="4" id="TTC.c29.s4">Every green leaf, every blade of grass and blade of grain, was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people.</s> <s sid="5" id="TTC.c29.s5">Everything was bowed down, dejected, oppressed, and broken.</s> <s sid="6" id="TTC.c29.s6">Habitations, fences, domesticated animals, men, women, children, and the soil that bore them--all worn out.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="TTC.c29.p3"><s sid="7" id="TTC.c29.s7">Monseigneur (often a most worthy individual gentleman) was a national blessing, gave a chivalrous tone to things, was a polite example of luxurious and shining fife, and a great deal more to equal purpose; nevertheless, Monseigneur as a class had, somehow or other, brought things to this.</s> <s sid="8" id="TTC.c29.s8">Strange that Creation, designed expressly for Monseigneur, should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out!</s> <s sid="9" id="TTC.c29.s9">There must be something short-sighted in the eternal arrangements, surely!</s> <s sid="10" id="TTC.c29.s10">Thus it was, however; and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints, and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled, and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite, Monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="TTC.c29.p4"><s sid="11" id="TTC.c29.s11">But, this was not the change on the village, and on many a village like it.</s> <s sid="12" id="TTC.c29.s12">For scores of years gone by, Monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it, and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase--now, found in hunting the people; now, found in hunting the beasts, for whose preservation Monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness.</s> <s sid="13" id="TTC.c29.s13">No.  The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of Monseigneur.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="TTC.c29.p6"><s sid="16" id="TTC.c29.s16">Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather, as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="TTC.c29.p42"><s sid="98" id="TTC.c29.s98">The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn.</s> <s sid="99" id="TTC.c29.s99">In the roaring and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away.</s> <s sid="100" id="TTC.c29.s100">With the rising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in torment.</s> <s sid="101" id="TTC.c29.s101">When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured:  anon struggled out of the smoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake and contending with the fire.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="TTC.c29.p43"><s sid="102" id="TTC.c29.s102">The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire, scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke.</s> <s sid="103" id="TTC.c29.s103">Molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame.</s> <s sid="104" id="TTC.c29.s104">Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night- enshrouded roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next destination.</s> <s sid="105" id="TTC.c29.s105">The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="TTC.c29.p44"><s sid="106" id="TTC.c29.s106">Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference.</s> <s sid="107" id="TTC.c29.s107">Whereupon, Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel with himself.</s> <s sid="108" id="TTC.c29.s108">The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet, and crush a man or two below.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="TTC.c29.p45"><s sid="109" id="TTC.c29.s109">Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.</s> <s sid="110" id="TTC.c29.s110">A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved!</s> <s sid="111" id="TTC.c29.s111">But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed, and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while.</s> </p>
