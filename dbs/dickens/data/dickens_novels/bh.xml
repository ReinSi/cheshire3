<stru>PREFACE





A Chancery judge once had the kindness to inform me, as one of a

company of some hundred and fifty men and women not labouring under

any suspicions of lunacy, that the Court of Chancery, though the

shining subject of much popular prejudice (at which point I thought

the judge's eye had a cast in my direction), was almost immaculate.

There had been, he admitted, a trivial blemish or so in its rate of

progress, but this was exaggerated and had been entirely owing to

the "parsimony of the public," which guilty public, it appeared,

had been until lately bent in the most determined manner on by no

means enlarging the number of Chancery judges appointed--I believe

by Richard the Second, but any other king will do as well.



This seemed to me too profound a joke to be inserted in the body of

this book or I should have restored it to Conversation Kenge or to

Mr. Vholes, with one or other of whom I think it must have

originated.  In such mouths I might have coupled it with an apt

quotation from one of Shakespeare's sonnets:



    "My nature is subdued

     To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:

     Pity me, then, and wish I were renewed!"



But as it is wholesome that the parsimonious public should know

what has been doing, and still is doing, in this connexion, I

mention here that everything set forth in these pages concerning

the Court of Chancery is substantially true, and within the truth.

The case of Gridley is in no essential altered from one of actual

occurrence, made public by a disinterested person who was

professionally acquainted with the whole of the monstrous wrong

from beginning to end.  At the present moment (August, 1853) there

is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years

ago, in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to

appear at one time, in which costs have been incurred to the amount

of seventy thousand pounds, which is A FRIENDLY SUIT, and which is

(I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was

begun.  There is another well-known suit in Chancery, not yet

decided, which was commenced before the close of the last century

and in which more than double the amount of seventy thousand pounds

has been swallowed up in costs.  If I wanted other authorities for

Jarndyce and Jarndyce, I could rain them on these pages, to the

shame of--a parsimonious public.



There is only one other point on which I offer a word of remark.

The possibility of what is called spontaneous combustion has been

denied since the death of Mr. Krook; and my good friend Mr. Lewes

(quite mistaken, as he soon found, in supposing the thing to have

been abandoned by all authorities) published some ingenious letters

to me at the time when that event was chronicled, arguing that

spontaneous combustion could not possibly be.  I have no need to

observe that I do not wilfully or negligently mislead my readers

and that before I wrote that description I took pains to

investigate the subject.  There are about thirty cases on record,

of which the most famous, that of the Countess Cornelia de Baudi

Cesenate, was minutely investigated and described by Giuseppe

Bianchini, a prebendary of Verona, otherwise distinguished in

letters, who published an account of it at Verona in 1731, which he

afterwards republished at Rome.  The appearances, beyond all

rational doubt, observed in that case are the appearances observed

in Mr. Krook's case.  The next most famous instance happened at

Rheims six years earlier, and the historian in that case is Le Cat,

one of the most renowned surgeons produced by France.  The subject

was a woman, whose husband was ignorantly convicted of having

murdered her; but on solemn appeal to a higher court, he was

acquitted because it was shown upon the evidence that she had died

the death of which this name of spontaneous combustion is given.  I

do not think it necessary to add to these notable facts, and that

general reference to the authorities which will be found at page

30, vol. ii.,* the recorded opinions and experiences of

distinguished medical professors, French, English, and Scotch, in

more modern days, contenting myself with observing that I shall not

abandon the facts until there shall have been a considerable

spontaneous combustion of the testimony on which human occurrences

are usually received.



In Bleak House I have purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of

familiar things.





1853





* Another case, very clearly described by a dentist, occurred at

the town of Columbus, in the United States of America, quite

recently.  The subject was a German who kept a liquor-shop and was

an inveterate drunkard.</stru>

<p pid="2" id="BH.c1.p2"><s sid="9" id="BH.c1.s9">Fog everywhere.</s> <s sid="10" id="BH.c1.s10">Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls deified among the tiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city.</s> <s sid="11" id="BH.c1.s11">Fog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights.</s> <s sid="12" id="BH.c1.s12">Fog creeping into the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and hovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and small boats.</s> <s sid="13" id="BH.c1.s13">Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient Greenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper, down in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of his shivering little 'prentice boy on deck.</s> <s sid="14" id="BH.c1.s14">Chance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog all round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the misty clouds.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BH.c1.p3"><s sid="15" id="BH.c1.s15">Gas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets, much as the sun may, from the spongey fields, be seen to loom by husbandman and ploughboy.</s> <s sid="16" id="BH.c1.s16">Most of the shops lighted two hours before their time--as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard and unwilling look.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BH.c1.p4"><s sid="17" id="BH.c1.s17">The raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog is densest, and the muddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction, appropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old corporation, Temple Bar.</s> <s sid="18" id="BH.c1.s18">And hard by Temple Bar, in Lincoln's Inn Hall, at the very heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BH.c1.p5"><s sid="19" id="BH.c1.s19">Never can there come fog too thick, never can there come mud and mire too deep, to assort with the groping and floundering condition which this High Court of Chancery, most pestilent of hoary sinners, holds this day in the sight of heaven and earth.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="BH.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="BH.c1.s20">On such an afternoon, if ever, the Lord High Chancellor ought to be sitting here--as here he is--with a foggy glory round his head, softly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains, addressed by a large advocate with great whiskers, a little voice, and an interminable brief, and outwardly directing his contemplation to the lantern in the roof, where he can see nothing but fog.</s> <s sid="21" id="BH.c1.s21">On such an afternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar ought to be--as here they are--mistily engaged in one of the ten thousand stages of an endless cause, tripping one another up on slippery precedents, groping knee-deep in technicalities, running their goat-hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words and making a pretence of equity with serious faces, as players might.</s> <s sid="22" id="BH.c1.s22">On such an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause, some two or three of whom have inherited it from their fathers, who made a fortune by it, ought to be--as are they not?--ranged in a line, in a long matted well (but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom of it) between the registrar's red table and the silk gowns, with bills, cross-bills, answers, rejoinders, injunctions, affidavits, issues, references to masters, masters' reports, mountains of costly nonsense, piled before them.</s> <s sid="23" id="BH.c1.s23">Well may the court be dim, with wasting candles here and there; well may the fog hang heavy in it, as if it would never get out; well may the stained-glass windows lose their colour and admit no light of day into the place; well may the uninitiated from the streets, who peep in through the glass panes in the door, be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect and by the drawl, languidly echoing to the roof from the padded dais where the Lord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it and where the attendant wigs are all stuck in a fog-bank!</s> <s sid="24" id="BH.c1.s24">This is the Court of Chancery, which has its decaying houses and its blighted lands in every shire, which has its worn-out lunatic in every madhouse and its dead in every churchyard, which has its ruined suitor with his slipshod heels and threadbare dress borrowing and begging through the round of every man's acquaintance, which gives to monied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right, which so exhausts finances, patience, courage, hope, so overthrows the brain and breaks the heart, that there is not an honourable man among its practitioners who would not give--who does not often give--the warning, <qs/>"Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than come here!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="7" id="BH.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="BH.c1.s25">Who happen to be in the Lord Chancellor's court this murky afternoon besides the Lord Chancellor, the counsel in the cause, two or three counsel who are never in any cause, and the well of solicitors before mentioned?</s> <s sid="26" id="BH.c1.s26">There is the registrar below the judge, in wig and gown; and there are two or three maces, or petty- bags, or privy purses, or whatever they may be, in legal court suits.</s> <s sid="27" id="BH.c1.s27">These are all yawning, for no crumb of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce (the cause in hand), which was squeezed dry years upon years ago.</s> <s sid="28" id="BH.c1.s28">The short-hand writers, the reporters of the court, and the reporters of the newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when Jarndyce and Jarndyce comes on.</s> <s sid="29" id="BH.c1.s29">Their places are a blank.</s> <s sid="30" id="BH.c1.s30">Standing on a seat at the side of the hall, the better to peer into the curtained sanctuary, is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is always in court, from its sitting to its rising, and always expecting some incomprehensible judgment to be given in her favour.</s> <s sid="31" id="BH.c1.s31">Some say she really is, or was, a party to a suit, but no one knows for certain because no one cares.</s> <s sid="32" id="BH.c1.s32">She carries some small litter in a reticule which she calls her documents, principally consisting of paper matches and dry lavender.</s> <s sid="33" id="BH.c1.s33">A sallow prisoner has come up, in custody, for the half- dozenth time to make a personal application <qs/>"to purge himself of his contempt,"<qe/> which, being a solitary surviving executor who has fallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts of which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge, he is not at all likely ever to do.</s> <s sid="34" id="BH.c1.s34">In the meantime his prospects in life are ended.</s> <s sid="35" id="BH.c1.s35">Another ruined suitor, who periodically appears from Shropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at the close of the day's business and who can by no means be made to understand that the Chancellor is legally ignorant of his existence after making it desolate for a quarter of a century, plants himself in a good place and keeps an eye on the judge, ready to call out <qs/>"My Lord!"<qe/> in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his rising.</s> <s sid="36" id="BH.c1.s36">A few lawyers' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger on the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal weather a little.</s> </p><p pid="8" id="BH.c1.p8"><s sid="37" id="BH.c1.s37">Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on.</s> <s sid="38" id="BH.c1.s38">This scarecrow of a suit has, in course of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it means.</s> <s sid="39" id="BH.c1.s39">The parties to it understand it least, but it has been observed that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five minutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises.</s> <s sid="40" id="BH.c1.s40">Innumerable children have been born into the cause; innumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people have died out of it.</s> <s sid="41" id="BH.c1.s41">Scores of persons have deliriously found themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how or why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the suit.</s> <s sid="42" id="BH.c1.s42">The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new rocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown up, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the other world.</s> <s sid="43" id="BH.c1.s43">Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and grandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone out; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere bills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth perhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a coffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags its dreary length before the court, perennially hopeless.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="BH.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="BH.c1.s44">Jarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke.</s> <s sid="45" id="BH.c1.s45">That is the only good that has ever come of it.</s> <s sid="46" id="BH.c1.s46">It has been death to many, but it is a joke in the profession.</s> <s sid="47" id="BH.c1.s47">Every master in Chancery has had a reference out of it.</s> <s sid="48" id="BH.c1.s48">Every Chancellor was <qs/>"in it,"<qe/> for somebody or other, when he was counsel at the bar.</s> <s sid="49" id="BH.c1.s49">Good things have been said about it by blue-nosed, bulbous-shoed old benchers in select port- wine committee after dinner in hall.</s> <s sid="50" id="BH.c1.s50">Articled clerks have been in the habit of fleshing their legal wit upon it.</s> <s sid="51" id="BH.c1.s51">The last Lord Chancellor handled it neatly, when, correcting Mr. Blowers, the eminent silk gown who said that such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes, he observed, <qs/>"or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mr. Blowers"<qe/>--a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces, bags, and purses.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="BH.c1.p10"><s sid="52" id="BH.c1.s52">How many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched forth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt would be a very wide question.</s> <s sid="53" id="BH.c1.s53">From the master upon whose impaling files reams of dusty warrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many shapes, down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerks' Office who has copied his tens of thousands of Chancery folio-pages under that eternal heading, no man's nature has been made better by it.</s> <s sid="54" id="BH.c1.s54">In trickery, evasion, procrastination, spoliation, botheration, under false pretences of all sorts, there are influences that can never come to good.</s> <s sid="55" id="BH.c1.s55">The very solicitors' boys who have kept the wretched suitors at bay, by protesting time out of mind that Mr. Chizzle, Mizzle, or otherwise was particularly engaged and had appointments until dinner, may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into themselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce.</s> <s sid="56" id="BH.c1.s56">The receiver in the cause has acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a distrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind.</s> <s sid="57" id="BH.c1.s57">Chizzle, Mizzle, and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising themselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter and see what can be done for Drizzle--who was not well used--when Jarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office.</s> <s sid="58" id="BH.c1.s58">Shirking and sharking in all their many varieties have been sown broadcast by the ill-fated cause; and even those who have contemplated its history from the outermost circle of such evil have been insensibly tempted into a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad course, and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some off-hand manner never meant to go right.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="BH.c1.p11"><s sid="59" id="BH.c1.s59">Thus, in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BH.c2.p2"><s sid="4" id="BH.c2.s4">It is not a large world.</s> <s sid="5" id="BH.c2.s5">Relatively even to this world of ours, which has its limits too (as your Highness shall find when you have made the tour of it and are come to the brink of the void beyond), it is a very little speck.</s> <s sid="6" id="BH.c2.s6">There is much good in it; there are many good and true people in it; it has its appointed place.</s> <s sid="7" id="BH.c2.s7">But the evil of it is that it is a world wrapped up in too much jeweller's cotton and fine wool, and cannot hear the rushing of the larger worlds, and cannot see them as they circle round the sun.</s> <s sid="8" id="BH.c2.s8">It is a deadened world, and its growth is sometimes unhealthy for want of air.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BH.c2.p3" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="BH.c2.s9">My Lady Dedlock has returned to her house in town for a few days previous to her departure for Paris, where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks, after which her movements are uncertain.</s> <s sid="10" id="BH.c2.s10">The fashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the Parisians, and it knows all fashionable things.</s> <s sid="11" id="BH.c2.s11">To know things otherwise were to be unfashionable.</s> <s sid="12" id="BH.c2.s12">My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls, in familiar conversation, her "place" in Lincolnshire.</s> <s sid="13" id="BH.c2.s13">The waters are out in Lincolnshire.</s> <s sid="14" id="BH.c2.s14">An arch of the bridge in the park has been sapped and sopped away.</s> <s sid="15" id="BH.c2.s15">The adjacent low-lying ground for half a mile in breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for islands in it and a surface punctured all over, all day long, with falling rain.</s> <s sid="16" id="BH.c2.s16">My Lady Dedlock's place has been extremely dreary.</s> <s sid="17" id="BH.c2.s17">The weather for many a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through, and the soft loppings and prunings of the woodman's axe can make no crash or crackle as they fall.</s> <s sid="18" id="BH.c2.s18">The deer, looking soaked, leave quagmires where they pass.</s> <s sid="19" id="BH.c2.s19">The shot of a rifle loses its sharpness in the moist air, and its smoke moves in a tardy little cloud towards the green rise, coppice-topped, that makes a background for the falling rain.</s> <s sid="20" id="BH.c2.s20">The view from my Lady Dedlock's own windows is alternately a lead-coloured view and a view in Indian ink.</s> <s sid="21" id="BH.c2.s21">The vases on the stone terrace in the foreground catch the rain all day; and the heavy drops fall--drip, drip, drip--upon the broad flagged pavement, called from old time the Ghost's Walk, all night.</s> <s sid="22" id="BH.c2.s22">On Sundays the little church in the park is mouldy; the oaken pulpit breaks out into a cold sweat; and there is a general smell and taste as of the ancient Dedlocks in their graves.</s> <s sid="23" id="BH.c2.s23">My Lady Dedlock (who is childless), looking out in the early twilight from her boudoir at a keeper's lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed panes, and smoke rising from the chimney, and a child, chased by a woman, running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a wrapped-up man coming through the gate, has been put quite out of temper.</s> <s sid="24" id="BH.c2.s24">My Lady Dedlock says she has been <qs/>"bored to death."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="4" id="BH.c2.p4"><s sid="25" id="BH.c2.s25">Therefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in Lincolnshire and has left it to the rain, and the crows, and the rabbits, and the deer, and the partridges and pheasants.</s> <s sid="26" id="BH.c2.s26">The pictures of the Dedlocks past and gone have seemed to vanish into the damp walls in mere lowness of spirits, as the housekeeper has passed along the old rooms shutting up the shutters.</s> <s sid="27" id="BH.c2.s27">And when they will next come forth again, the fashionable intelligence--which, like the fiend, is omniscient of the past and present, but not the future--cannot yet undertake to say.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BH.c2.p5"><s sid="28" id="BH.c2.s28">Sir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet, but there is no mightier baronet than he.</s> <s sid="29" id="BH.c2.s29">His family is as old as the hills, and infinitely more respectable.</s> <s sid="30" id="BH.c2.s30">He has a general opinion that the world might get on without hills but would be done up without Dedlocks.</s> <s sid="31" id="BH.c2.s31">He would on the whole admit nature to be a good idea (a little low, perhaps, when not enclosed with a park-fence), but an idea dependent for its execution on your great county families.</s> <s sid="32" id="BH.c2.s32">He is a gentleman of strict conscience, disdainful of all littleness and meanness and ready on the shortest notice to die any death you may please to mention rather than give occasion for the least impeachment of his integrity.</s> <s sid="33" id="BH.c2.s33">He is an honourable, obstinate, truthful, high-spirited, intensely prejudiced, perfectly unreasonable man.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="BH.c2.p6"><s sid="34" id="BH.c2.s34">Sir Leicester is twenty years, full measure, older than my Lady.</s> <s sid="35" id="BH.c2.s35">He will never see sixty-five again, nor perhaps sixty-six, nor yet sixty-seven.</s> <s sid="36" id="BH.c2.s36">He has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a little stiffly.</s> <s sid="37" id="BH.c2.s37">He is of a worthy presence, with his light-grey hair and whiskers, his fine shirt-frill, his pure-white waistcoat, and his blue coat with bright buttons always buttoned.</s> <s sid="38" id="BH.c2.s38">He is ceremonious, stately, most polite on every occasion to my Lady, and holds her personal attractions in the highest estimation.</s> <s sid="39" id="BH.c2.s39">His gallantry to my Lady, which has never changed since he courted her, is the one little touch of romantic fancy in him.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="BH.c2.p7"><s sid="40" id="BH.c2.s40">Indeed, he married her for love.</s> <s sid="41" id="BH.c2.s41">A whisper still goes about that she had not even family; howbeit, Sir Leicester had so much family that perhaps he had enough and could dispense with any more.</s> <s sid="42" id="BH.c2.s42">But she had beauty, pride, ambition, insolent resolve, and sense enough to portion out a legion of fine ladies.</s> <s sid="43" id="BH.c2.s43">Wealth and station, added to these, soon floated her upward, and for years now my Lady Dedlock has been at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and at the top of the fashionable tree.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="BH.c2.p8"><s sid="44" id="BH.c2.s44">How Alexander wept when he had no more worlds to conquer, everybody knows--or has some reason to know by this time, the matter having been rather frequently mentioned.</s> <s sid="45" id="BH.c2.s45">My Lady Dedlock, having conquered HER world, fell not into the melting, but rather into the freezing, mood.</s> <s sid="46" id="BH.c2.s46">An exhausted composure, a worn-out placidity, an equanimity of fatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction, are the trophies of her victory.</s> <s sid="47" id="BH.c2.s47">She is perfectly well-bred.</s> <s sid="48" id="BH.c2.s48">If she could be translated to heaven to-morrow, she might be expected to ascend without any rapture.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="BH.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="BH.c2.s49">She has beauty still, and if it be not in its heyday, it is not yet in its autumn.</s> <s sid="50" id="BH.c2.s50">She has a fine face--originally of a character that would be rather called very pretty than handsome, but improved into classicality by the acquired expression of her fashionable state.</s> <s sid="51" id="BH.c2.s51">Her figure is elegant and has the effect of being tall.</s> <s sid="52" id="BH.c2.s52">Not that she is so, but that <qs/>"the most is made,"<qe/><sls/> as the Honourable Bob Stables has frequently asserted upon oath, <sle/><qs/>"of all her points."<qe/></s> <s sid="53" id="BH.c2.s53">The same authority observes that she is perfectly got up and remarks in commendation of her hair especially that she is the best-groomed woman in the whole stud.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="BH.c2.p10"><s sid="54" id="BH.c2.s54">With all her perfections on her head, my Lady Dedlock has come up from her place in Lincolnshire (hotly pursued by the fashionable intelligence) to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her departure for Paris, where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks, after which her movements are uncertain.</s> <s sid="55" id="BH.c2.s55">And at her house in town, upon this muddy, murky afternoon, presents himself an old- fashioned old gentleman, attorney-at-law and eke solicitor of the High Court of Chancery, who has the honour of acting as legal adviser of the Dedlocks and has as many cast-iron boxes in his office with that name outside as if the present baronet were the coin of the conjuror's trick and were constantly being juggled through the whole set.</s> <s sid="56" id="BH.c2.s56">Across the hall, and up the stairs, and along the passages, and through the rooms, which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of it--fairy-land to visit, but a desert to live in--the old gentleman is conducted by a Mercury in powder to my Lady's presence.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="BH.c2.p11" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="BH.c2.s57">The old gentleman is rusty to look at, but is reputed to have made good thrift out of aristocratic marriage settlements and aristocratic wills, and to be very rich.</s> <s sid="58" id="BH.c2.s58">He is surrounded by a mysterious halo of family confidences, of which he is known to be the silent depository.</s> <s sid="59" id="BH.c2.s59">There are noble mausoleums rooted for centuries in retired glades of parks among the growing timber and the fern, which perhaps hold fewer noble secrets than walk abroad among men, shut up in the breast of Mr. Tulkinghorn.</s> <s sid="60" id="BH.c2.s60">He is of what is called the old school--a phrase generally meaning any school that seems never to have been young--and wears knee-breeches tied with ribbons, and gaiters or stockings.</s> <s sid="61" id="BH.c2.s61">One peculiarity of his black clothes and of his black stockings, be they silk or worsted, is that they never shine.</s> <s sid="62" id="BH.c2.s62">Mute, close, irresponsive to any glancing light, his dress is like himself.</s> <s sid="63" id="BH.c2.s63">He never converses when not professionaly consulted.</s> <s sid="64" id="BH.c2.s64">He is found sometimes, speechless but quite at home, at corners of dinner-tables in great country houses and near doors of drawing-rooms, concerning which the fashionable intelligence is eloquent, where everybody knows him and where half the Peerage stops to say <qs/>"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?"<qe/></s> <s sid="65" id="BH.c2.s65">He receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with the rest of his knowledge.</s> </p><p pid="12" id="BH.c2.p12"><s sid="66" id="BH.c2.s66">Sir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr. Tulkinghorn.</s> <s sid="67" id="BH.c2.s67">There is an air of prescription about him which is always agreeable to Sir Leicester; he receives it as a kind of tribute.</s> <s sid="68" id="BH.c2.s68">He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn's dress; there is a kind of tribute in that too.</s> <s sid="69" id="BH.c2.s69">It is eminently respectable, and likewise, in a general way, retainer-like.</s> <s sid="70" id="BH.c2.s70">It expresses, as it were, the steward of the legal mysteries, the butler of the legal cellar, of the Dedlocks.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="BH.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="BH.c2.s71">Has Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself?</s> <s sid="72" id="BH.c2.s72">It may be so, or it may not, but there is this remarkable circumstance to be noted in everything associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a class--as one of the leaders and representatives of her little world.</s> <s sid="73" id="BH.c2.s73">She supposes herself to be an inscrutable Being, quite out of the reach and ken of ordinary mortals--seeing herself in her glass, where indeed she looks so.</s> <s sid="74" id="BH.c2.s74">Yet every dim little star revolving about her, from her maid to the manager of the Italian Opera, knows her weaknesses, prejudices, follies, haughtinesses, and caprices and lives upon as accurate a calculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her dressmaker takes of her physical proportions.</s> <s sid="75" id="BH.c2.s75">Is a new dress, a new custom, a new singer, a new dancer, a new form of jewellery, a new dwarf or giant, a new chapel, a new anything, to be set up?</s> <s sid="76" id="BH.c2.s76">There are deferential people in a dozen callings whom my Lady Dedlock suspects of nothing but prostration before her, who can tell you how to manage her as if she were a baby, who do nothing but nurse her all their lives, who, humbly affecting to follow with profound subservience, lead her and her whole troop after them; who, in hooking one, hook all and bear them off as Lemuel Gulliver bore away the stately fleet of the majestic Lilliput.</s> <s sid="77" id="BH.c2.s77"><qs/>"If you want to address our people, sir,"<qe/><sls/> say Blaze and Sparkle, the jewellers--meaning by our people Lady Dedlock and the rest--<sle/><qs/>"you must remember that you are not dealing with the general public; you must hit our people in their weakest place, and their weakest place is such a place."<qe/></s> <s sid="78" id="BH.c2.s78"><qs/>"To make this article go down, gentlemen,"<qe/><sls/> say Sheen and Gloss, the mercers, to their friends the manufacturers, <sle/><qs/>"you must come to us, because we know where to have the fashionable people, and we can make it fashionable."<qe/></s> <s sid="79" id="BH.c2.s79"><qs/>"If you want to get this print upon the tables of my high connexion, sir,"<qe/><sls/> says Mr. Sladdery, the librarian, <sle/><qs/>"or if you want to get this dwarf or giant into the houses of my high connexion, sir, or if you want to secure to this entertainment the patronage of my high connexion, sir, you must leave it, if you please, to me, for I have been accustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion, sir, and I may tell you without vanity that I can turn them round my finger"<qe/>-- in which Mr. Sladdery, who is an honest man, does not exaggerate at all.</s> </p><p pid="14" id="BH.c2.p14"><s sid="80" id="BH.c2.s80">Therefore, while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in the Dedlock mind at present, it is very possible that he may.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="BH.c2.p15" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="BH.c2.s81"><qs/>"My Lady's cause has been again before the Chancellor, has it, Mr. Tulkinghorn?"<qe/> says Sir Leicester, giving him his hand.</s> </p><p pid="16" id="BH.c2.p16" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="BH.c2.s82"><qs/>"Yes.</s> <s sid="83" id="BH.c2.s83">It has been on again to-day,"<qe/> Mr. Tulkinghorn replies, making one of his quiet bows to my Lady, who is on a sofa near the fire, shading her face with a hand-screen.</s> </p><p pid="17" id="BH.c2.p17" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="BH.c2.s84"><qs/>"It would be useless to ask,"<qe/><sls/> says my Lady with the dreariness of the place in Lincolnshire still upon her, <sle/><qs/>"whether anything has been done."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="18" id="BH.c2.p18" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="BH.c2.s85"><qs/>"Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day,"<qe/> replies Mr. Tulkinghorn.</s> </p><p pid="19" id="BH.c2.p19" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="BH.c2.s86"><qs/>"Nor ever will be,"<qe/> says my Lady.</s> </p><p pid="20" id="BH.c2.p20"><s sid="87" id="BH.c2.s87">Sir Leicester has no objection to an interminable Chancery suit.</s> <s sid="88" id="BH.c2.s88">It is a slow, expensive, British, constitutional kind of thing.</s> <s sid="89" id="BH.c2.s89">To be sure, he has not a vital interest in the suit in question, her part in which was the only property my Lady brought him; and he has a shadowy impression that for his name--the name of Dedlock--to be in a cause, and not in the title of that cause, is a most ridiculous accident.</s> <s sid="90" id="BH.c2.s90">But he regards the Court of Chancery, even if it should involve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling amount of confusion, as a something devised in conjunction with a variety of other somethings by the perfection of human wisdom for the eternal settlement (humanly speaking) of everything.</s> <s sid="91" id="BH.c2.s91">And he is upon the whole of a fixed opinion that to give the sanction of his countenance to any complaints respecting it would be to encourage some person in the lower classes to rise up somewhere--like Wat Tyler.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="BH.c2.p21" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="BH.c2.s92"><qs/>"As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file,"<qe/><sss/> says Mr. Tulkinghorn, <sse/><qs/>"and as they are short, and as I proceed upon the troublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any new proceedings in a cause"<qe/><sls/>--cautious man Mr. Tulkinghorn, taking no more responsibility than necessary--<sle/><qs/>"and further, as I see you are going to Paris, I have brought them in my pocket."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="22" id="BH.c2.p22"><s sid="93" id="BH.c2.s93">(Sir Leicester was going to Paris too, by the by, but the delight of the fashionable intelligence was in his Lady.)</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="BH.c2.p23"><s sid="94" id="BH.c2.s94">Mr. Tulkinghorn takes out his papers, asks permission to place them on a golden talisman of a table at my Lady's elbow, puts on his spectacles, and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="BH.c2.p24" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="BH.c2.s95"><qs/>"'In Chancery.</s> <s sid="96" id="BH.c2.s96">Between John Jarndyce--'"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="BH.c2.p25"><s sid="97" id="BH.c2.s97">My Lady interrupts, requesting him to miss as many of the formal horrors as he can.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER X The Law-Writer</title>

<p pid="1" id="BH.c10.p1"><s sid="1" id="BH.c10.s1">On the eastern borders of Chancery Lane, that is to say, more particularly in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby, law- stationer, pursues his lawful calling.</s> <s sid="2" id="BH.c10.s2">In the shade of Cook's Court, at most times a shady place, Mr. Snagsby has dealt in all sorts of blank forms of legal process; in skins and rolls of parchment; in paper--foolscap, brief, draft, brown, white, whitey- brown, and blotting; in stamps; in office-quills, pens, ink, India- rubber, pounce, pins, pencils, sealing-wax, and wafers; in red tape and green ferret; in pocket-books, almanacs, diaries, and law lists; in string boxes, rulers, inkstands--glass and leaden--pen-knives, scissors, bodkins, and other small office-cutlery; in short, in articles too numerous to mention, ever since he was out of his time and went into partnership with Peffer.</s> <s sid="3" id="BH.c10.s3">On that occasion, Cook's Court was in a manner revolutionized by the new inscription in fresh paint, PEFFER AND SNAGSBY, displacing the time-honoured and not easily to be deciphered legend PEFFER only.</s> <s sid="4" id="BH.c10.s4">For smoke, which is the London ivy, had so wreathed itself round Peffer's name and clung to his dwelling-place that the affectionate parasite quite overpowered the parent tree.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BH.c10.p2"><s sid="5" id="BH.c10.s5">Peffer is never seen in Cook's Court now.</s> <s sid="6" id="BH.c10.s6">He is not expected there, for he has been recumbent this quarter of a century in the churchyard of St.</s> <s sid="7" id="BH.c10.s7">Andrews, Holborn, with the waggons and hackney- coaches roaring past him all the day and half the night like one great dragon.</s> <s sid="8" id="BH.c10.s8">If he ever steal forth when the dragon is at rest to air himself again in Cook's Court until admonished to return by the crowing of the sanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in Cursitor Street, whose ideas of daylight it would be curious to ascertain, since he knows from his personal observation next to nothing about it--if Peffer ever do revisit the pale glimpses of Cook's Court, which no law-stationer in the trade can positively deny, he comes invisibly, and no one is the worse or wiser.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BH.c10.p3"><s sid="9" id="BH.c10.s9">In his lifetime, and likewise in the period of Snagsby's "time" of seven long years, there dwelt with Peffer in the same law- stationering premises a niece--a short, shrewd niece, something too violently compressed about the waist, and with a sharp nose like a sharp autumn evening, inclining to be frosty towards the end.</s> <s sid="10" id="BH.c10.s10">The Cook's Courtiers had a rumour flying among them that the mother of this niece did, in her daughter's childhood, moved by too jealous a solicitude that her figure should approach perfection, lace her up every morning with her maternal foot against the bed-post for a stronger hold and purchase; and further, that she exhibited internally pints of vinegar and lemon-juice, which acids, they held, had mounted to the nose and temper of the patient.</s> <s sid="11" id="BH.c10.s11">With whichsoever of the many tongues of Rumour this frothy report originated, it either never reached or never influenced the ears of young Snagsby, who, having wooed and won its fair subject on his arrival at man's estate, entered into two partnerships at once.</s> <s sid="12" id="BH.c10.s12">So now, in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby and the niece are one; and the niece still cherishes her figure, which, however tastes may differ, is unquestionably so far precious that there is mighty little of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BH.c10.p4" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="BH.c10.s13">Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh, but, to the neighbours' thinking, one voice too.</s> <s sid="14" id="BH.c10.s14">That voice, appearing to proceed from Mrs. Snagsby alone, is heard in Cook's Court very often.</s> <s sid="15" id="BH.c10.s15">Mr. Snagsby, otherwise than as he finds expression through these dulcet tones, is rarely heard.</s> <s sid="16" id="BH.c10.s16">He is a mild, bald, timid man with a shining head and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out at the back.</s> <s sid="17" id="BH.c10.s17">He tends to meekness and obesity.</s> <s sid="18" id="BH.c10.s18">As he stands at his door in Cook's Court in his grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves, looking up at the clouds, or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy flat ruler, snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his two 'prentices, he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man.</s> <s sid="19" id="BH.c10.s19">From beneath his feet, at such times, as from a shrill ghost unquiet in its grave, there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in the voice already mentioned; and haply, on some occasions when these reach a sharper pitch than usual, Mr. Snagsby mentions to the 'prentices, <qs/>"I think my little woman is a-giving it to Guster!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="BH.c10.p5" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="BH.c10.s20">This proper name, so used by Mr. Snagsby, has before now sharpened the wit of the Cook's Courtiers to remark that it ought to be the name of Mrs. Snagsby, seeing that she might with great force and expression be termed a Guster, in compliment to her stormy character.</s> <s sid="21" id="BH.c10.s21">It is, however, the possession, and the only possession except fifty shillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with clothing, of a lean young woman from a workhouse (by some supposed to have been christened Augusta) who, although she was farmed or contracted for during her growing time by an amiable benefactor of his species resident at Tooting, and cannot fail to have been developed under the most favourable circumstances, <qs/>"has fits,"<qe/> which the parish can't account for.</s> </p><p pid="6" id="BH.c10.p6"><s sid="22" id="BH.c10.s22">Guster, really aged three or four and twenty, but looking a round ten years older, goes cheap with this unaccountable drawback of fits, and is so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of her patron saint that except when she is found with her head in the pail, or the sink, or the copper, or the dinner, or anything else that happens to be near her at the time of her seizure, she is always at work.</s> <s sid="23" id="BH.c10.s23">She is a satisfaction to the parents and guardians of the 'prentices, who feel that there is little danger of her inspiring tender emotions in the breast of youth; she is a satisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby, who can always find fault with her; she is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby, who thinks it a charity to keep her.</s> <s sid="24" id="BH.c10.s24">The law-stationer's establishment is, in Guster's eyes, a temple of plenty and splendour.</s> <s sid="25" id="BH.c10.s25">She believes the little drawing- room upstairs, always kept, as one may say, with its hair in papers and its pinafore on, to be the most elegant apartment in Christendom.</s> <s sid="26" id="BH.c10.s26">The view it commands of Cook's Court at one end (not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street) and of Coavinses' the sheriff's officer's backyard at the other she regards as a prospect of unequalled beauty.</s> <s sid="27" id="BH.c10.s27">The portraits it displays in oil--and plenty of it too--of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby and of Mrs. Snagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby are in her eyes as achievements of Raphael or Titian.</s> <s sid="28" id="BH.c10.s28">Guster has some recompenses for her many privations.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BH.c13.p1"><s sid="1" id="BH.c13.s1">We held many consultations about what Richard was to be, first without Mr. Jarndyce, as he had requested, and afterwards with him, but it was a long time before we seemed to make progress.</s> <s sid="2" id="BH.c13.s2">Richard said he was ready for anything.</s> <s sid="3" id="BH.c13.s3">When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he might not already be too old to enter the Navy, Richard said he had thought of that, and perhaps he was.</s> <s sid="4" id="BH.c13.s4">When Mr. Jarndyce asked him what he thought of the Army, Richard said he had thought of that, too, and it wasn't a bad idea.</s> <s sid="5" id="BH.c13.s5">When Mr. Jarndyce advised him to try and decide within himself whether his old preference for the sea was an ordinary boyish inclination or a strong impulse, Richard answered, Well he really HAD tried very often, and he couldn't make out.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BH.c13.p2" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="BH.c13.s6"><qs/>"How much of this indecision of character,"<qe/><sls/> Mr. Jarndyce said to me, <sle/><qs/>"is chargeable on that incomprehensible heap of uncertainty and procrastination on which he has been thrown from his birth, I don't pretend to say; but that Chancery, among its other sins, is responsible for some of it, I can plainly see.</s> <s sid="7" id="BH.c13.s7">It has engendered or confirmed in him a habit of putting off--and trusting to this, that, and the other chance, without knowing what chance--and dismissing everything as unsettled, uncertain, and confused.</s> <s sid="8" id="BH.c13.s8">The character of much older and steadier people may be even changed by the circumstances surrounding them.</s> <s sid="9" id="BH.c13.s9">It would be too much to expect that a boy's, in its formation, should be the subject of such influences and escape them."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="3" id="BH.c13.p3"><s sid="10" id="BH.c13.s10">I felt this to be true; though if I may venture to mention what I thought besides, I thought it much to be regretted that Richard's education had not counteracted those influences or directed his character.</s> <s sid="11" id="BH.c13.s11">He had been eight years at a public school and had learnt, I understood, to make Latin verses of several sorts in the most admirable manner.</s> <s sid="12" id="BH.c13.s12">But I never heard that it had been anybody's business to find out what his natural bent was, or where his failings lay, or to adapt any kind of knowledge to HIM.</s> <s sid="13" id="BH.c13.s13">HE had been adapted to the verses and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection that if he had remained at school until he was of age, I suppose he could only have gone on making them over and over again unless he had enlarged his education by forgetting how to do it.</s> <s sid="14" id="BH.c13.s14">Still, although I had no doubt that they were very beautiful, and very improving, and very sufficient for a great many purposes of life, and always remembered all through life, I did doubt whether Richard would not have profited by some one studying him a little, instead of his studying them quite so much.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BH.c13.p4"><s sid="15" id="BH.c13.s15">To be sure, I knew nothing of the subject and do not even now know whether the young gentlemen of classic Rome or Greece made verses to the same extent--or whether the young gentlemen of any country ever did.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BH.c13.p5" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="BH.c13.s16"><qs/>"I haven't the least idea,"<qe/><sss/> said Richard, musing, <sse/><qs/>"what I had better be.</s> <s sid="17" id="BH.c13.s17">Except that I am quite sure I don't want to go into the Church, it's a toss-up."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="BH.c13.p6" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="BH.c13.s18"><qs/>"You have no inclination in Mr. Kenge's way?"<qe/> suggested Mr. Jarndyce.</s> </p><p pid="7" id="BH.c13.p7" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="BH.c13.s19"><qs/>"I don't know that, sir!"<qe/> replied Richard.</s> <s sid="20" id="BH.c13.s20"><qs/>"I am fond of boating.</s> <s sid="21" id="BH.c13.s21">Articled clerks go a good deal on the water.</s> <s sid="22" id="BH.c13.s22">It's a capital profession!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="8" id="BH.c13.p8" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="BH.c13.s23"><qs/>"Surgeon--"<qe/> suggested Mr. Jarndyce.</s> </p><p pid="9" id="BH.c13.p9" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="BH.c13.s24"><qs/>"That's the thing, sir!"<qe/> cried Richard.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="BH.c13.p10"><s sid="25" id="BH.c13.s25">I doubt if he had ever once thought of it before.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="BH.c13.p11" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="BH.c13.s26"><qs/>"That's the thing, sir,"<qe/> repeated Richard with the greatest enthusiasm.</s> <s sid="27" id="BH.c13.s27"><qs/>"We have got it at last.</s> <s sid="28" id="BH.c13.s28">M.R.C.S.!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="12" id="BH.c13.p12"><s sid="29" id="BH.c13.s29">He was not to be laughed out of it, though he laughed at it heartily.</s> <s sid="30" id="BH.c13.s30">He said he had chosen his profession, and the more he thought of it, the more he felt that his destiny was clear; the art of healing was the art of all others for him.</s> <s sid="31" id="BH.c13.s31">Mistrusting that he only came to this conclusion because, having never had much chance of finding out for himself what he was fitted for and having never been guided to the discovery, he was taken by the newest idea and was glad to get rid of the trouble of consideration, I wondered whether the Latin verses often ended in this or whether Richard's was a solitary case.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="BH.c13.p13"><s sid="32" id="BH.c13.s32">Mr. Jarndyce took great pains to talk with him seriously and to put it to his good sense not to deceive himself in so important a matter.</s> <s sid="33" id="BH.c13.s33">Richard was a little grave after these interviews, but invariably told Ada and me that it was all right, and then began to talk about something else.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="BH.c13.p14" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="BH.c13.s34"><qs/>"By heaven!"<qe/><sls/> cried Mr. Boythorn, who interested himself strongly in the subject--though I need not say that, for he could do nothing weakly; <sle/><qs/>"I rejoice to find a young gentleman of spirit and gallantry devoting himself to that noble profession!</s> <s sid="35" id="BH.c13.s35">The more spirit there is in it, the better for mankind and the worse for those mercenary task-masters and low tricksters who delight in putting that illustrious art at a disadvantage in the world.</s> <s sid="36" id="BH.c13.s36">By all that is base and despicable,"<qe/><sss/> cried Mr. Boythorn, <sse/><qs/>"the treatment of surgeons aboard ship is such that I would submit the legs--both legs--of every member of the Admiralty Board to a compound fracture and render it a transportable offence in any qualified practitioner to set them if the system were not wholly changed in eight and forty hours!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="BH.c13.p15" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="BH.c13.s37"><qs/>"Wouldn't you give them a week?"<qe/> asked Mr. Jarndyce.</s> </p><p pid="16" id="BH.c13.p16" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="BH.c13.s38"><qs/>"No!"<qe/> cried Mr. Boythorn firmly.</s> <s sid="39" id="BH.c13.s39"><qs/>"Not on any consideration!</s> <s sid="40" id="BH.c13.s40">Eight and forty hours!</s> <s sid="41" id="BH.c13.s41">As to corporations, parishes, vestry-boards, and similar gatherings of jolter-headed clods who assemble to exchange such speeches that, by heaven, they ought to be worked in quicksilver mines for the short remainder of their miserable existence, if it were only to prevent their detestable English from contaminating a language spoken in the presence of the sun--as to those fellows, who meanly take advantage of the ardour of gentlemen in the pursuit of knowledge to recompense the inestimable services of the best years of their lives, their long study, and their expensive education with pittances too small for the acceptance of clerks, I would have the necks of every one of them wrung and their skulls arranged in Surgeons' Hall for the contemplation of the whole profession in order that its younger members might understand from actual measurement, in early life, HOW thick skulls may become!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="17" id="BH.c13.p17" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="BH.c13.s42">He wound up this vehement declaration by looking round upon us with a most agreeable smile and suddenly thundering, <qs/>"Ha, ha, ha!"<qe/> over and over again, until anybody else might have been expected to be quite subdued by the exertion.</s> </p><p pid="18" id="BH.c13.p18" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="BH.c13.s43">As Richard still continued to say that he was fixed in his choice after repeated periods for consideration had been recommended by Mr. Jarndyce and had expired, and he still continued to assure Ada and me in the same final manner that it was <qs/>"all right,"<qe/> it became advisable to take Mr. Kenge into council.</s> <s sid="44" id="BH.c13.s44">Mr. Kenge, therefore, came down to dinner one day, and leaned back in his chair, and turned his eye-glasses over and over, and spoke in a sonorous voice, and did exactly what I remembered to have seen him do when I was a little girl.</s> </p><p pid="19" id="BH.c13.p19" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="BH.c13.s45"><qs/>"Ah!"<qe/> said Mr. Kenge.</s> <s sid="46" id="BH.c13.s46"><qs/>"Yes.</s> <s sid="47" id="BH.c13.s47">Well!</s> <s sid="48" id="BH.c13.s48">A very good profession, Mr. Jarndyce, a very good profession."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="20" id="BH.c13.p20" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="BH.c13.s49"><qs/>"The course of study and preparation requires to be diligently pursued,"<qe/> observed my guardian with a glance at Richard.</s> </p><p pid="21" id="BH.c13.p21" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="BH.c13.s50"><qs/>"Oh, no doubt,"<qe/> said Mr. Kenge.</s> <s sid="51" id="BH.c13.s51"><qs/>"Diligently."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="22" id="BH.c13.p22" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="BH.c13.s52"><qs/>"But that being the case, more or less, with all pursuits that are worth much,"<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Jarndyce, <sse/><qs/>"it is not a special consideration which another choice would be likely to escape."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="BH.c13.p23" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="BH.c13.s53"><qs/>"Truly,"<qe/> said Mr. Kenge.</s> <s sid="54" id="BH.c13.s54"><qs/>"And Mr. Richard Carstone, who has so meritoriously acquitted himself in the--shall I say the classic shades?--in which his youth had been passed, will, no doubt, apply the habits, if not the principles and practice, of versification in that tongue in which a poet was said (unless I mistake) to be born, not made, to the more eminently practical field of action on which he enters."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="24" id="BH.c13.p24" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="BH.c13.s55"><qs/>"You may rely upon it,"<qe/><sls/> said Richard in his off-hand manner, <sle/><qs/>"that I shall go at it and do my best."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="BH.c13.p25" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="BH.c13.s56"><qs/>"Very well, Mr. Jarndyce!"<qe/> said Mr. Kenge, gently nodding his head.</s> <s sid="57" id="BH.c13.s57"><qs/>"Really, when we are assured by Mr. Richard that he means to go at it and to do his best,"<qe/><sls/> nodding feelingly and smoothly over those expressions, <sle/><qs/>"I would submit to you that we have only to inquire into the best mode of carrying out the object of his ambition.</s> <s sid="58" id="BH.c13.s58">Now, with reference to placing Mr. Richard with some sufficiently eminent practitioner.</s> <s sid="59" id="BH.c13.s59">Is there any one in view at

id="BH.c13.s63"><qs/>"As to situation, now.</s> <s sid="64" id="BH.c13.s64">Is there any particular feeling on that head?"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="29" id="BH.c13.p29" type="speech"><s sid="65"

id="BH.c13.p31" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="BH.c13.s67"><qs/>"I should like a little variety,"<qe/><sss/> said Richard; <sse/><qs/>"I mean a good range of experience."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="32" id="BH.c13.p32" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="BH.c13.s68"><qs/>"Very requisite, no doubt,"<qe/> returned Mr. Kenge.</s> <s sid="69" id="BH.c13.s69"><qs/>"I think this may be easily arranged, Mr. Jarndyce?</s> <s sid="70" id="BH.c13.s70">We have only, in the first place, to discover a sufficiently eligible practitioner; and as soon as we make our want--and shall I add, our ability to pay a premium?-- known, our only difficulty will be in the selection of one from a large number.</s> <s sid="71" id="BH.c13.s71">We have only, in the second place, to observe those little formalities which are rendered necessary by our time of life and our being under the guardianship of the court.</s> <s sid="72" id="BH.c13.s72">We shall soon be--shall I say, in Mr. Richard's own light-hearted manner, 'going at it'--to our heart's content.</s> <s sid="73" id="BH.c13.s73">It is a coincidence,"<qe/><sls/> said Mr. Kenge with a tinge of melancholy in his smile, <sle/><qs/>"one of those coincidences which may or may not require an explanation beyond our present limited faculties, that I have a cousin in the medical profession.</s> <s sid="74" id="BH.c13.s74">He might be deemed eligible by you and might be disposed to respond to this proposal.</s> <s sid="75" id="BH.c13.s75">I can answer for him as little as for you, but he MIGHT!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="33" id="BH.c13.p33"><s sid="76" id="BH.c13.s76">As this was an opening in the prospect, it was arranged that Mr. Kenge should see his cousin.</s> <s sid="77" id="BH.c13.s77">And as Mr. Jarndyce had before proposed to take us to London for a few weeks, it was settled next day that we should make our visit at once and combine Richard's business with it.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="BH.c13.p34"><s sid="78" id="BH.c13.s78">Mr. Boythorn leaving us within a week, we took up our abode at a cheerful lodging near Oxford Street over an upholsterer's shop.</s> <s sid="79" id="BH.c13.s79">London was a great wonder to us, and we were out for hours and hours at a time, seeing the sights, which appeared to be less capable of exhaustion than we were.</s> <s sid="80" id="BH.c13.s80">We made the round of the principal theatres, too, with great delight, and saw all the plays that were worth seeing.</s> <s sid="81" id="BH.c13.s81">I mention this because it was at the theatre that I began to be made uncomfortable again by Mr. Guppy.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="BH.c13.p35"><s sid="82" id="BH.c13.s82">I was sitting in front of the box one night with Ada, and Richard was in the place he liked best, behind Ada's chair, when, happening to look down into the pit, I saw Mr. Guppy, with his hair flattened down upon his head and woe depicted in his face, looking up at me.</s> <s sid="83" id="BH.c13.s83">I felt all through the performance that he never looked at the actors but constantly looked at me, and always with a carefully prepared expression of the deepest misery and the profoundest dejection.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="BH.c13.p36"><s sid="84" id="BH.c13.s84">It quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so very embarrassing and so very ridiculous.</s> <s sid="85" id="BH.c13.s85">But from that time forth, we never went to the play without my seeing Mr. Guppy in the pit, always with his hair straight and flat, his shirt-collar turned down, and a general feebleness about him.</s> <s sid="86" id="BH.c13.s86">If he were not there when we went in, and I began to hope he would not come and yielded myself for a little while to the interest of the scene, I was certain to encounter his languishing eyes when I least expected it and, from that time, to be quite sure that they were fixed upon me all the evening.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="BH.c13.p37"><s sid="87" id="BH.c13.s87">I really cannot express how uneasy this made me.</s> <s sid="88" id="BH.c13.s88">If he would only have brushed up his hair or turned up his collar, it would have been bad enough; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at me, and always in that demonstrative state of despondency, put such a constraint upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play, or to cry at it, or to move, or to speak.</s> <s sid="89" id="BH.c13.s89">I seemed able to do nothing naturally.</s> <s sid="90" id="BH.c13.s90">As to escaping Mr. Guppy by going to the back of the box, I could not bear to do that because I knew Richard and Ada relied on having me next them and that they could never have talked together so happily if anybody else had been in my place.</s> <s sid="91" id="BH.c13.s91">So there I sat, not knowing where to look--for wherever I looked, I knew Mr. Guppy's eyes were following me--and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this young man was putting himself on my account.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BH.c21.p1"><s sid="1" id="BH.c21.s1">In a rather ill-favoured and ill-savoured neighbourhood, though one of its rising grounds bears the name of Mount Pleasant, the Elfin Smallweed, christened Bartholomew and known on the domestic hearth as Bart, passes that limited portion of his time on which the office and its contingencies have no claim.</s> <s sid="2" id="BH.c21.s2">He dwells in a little narrow street, always solitary, shady, and sad, closely bricked in on all sides like a tomb, but where there yet lingers the stump of an old forest tree whose flavour is about as fresh and natural as the Smallweed smack of youth.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BH.c21.p2"><s sid="3" id="BH.c21.s3">There has been only one child in the Smallweed family for several generations.</s> <s sid="4" id="BH.c21.s4">Little old men and women there have been, but no child, until Mr. Smallweed's grandmother, now living, became weak in her intellect and fell (for the first time) into a childish state.</s> <s sid="5" id="BH.c21.s5">With such infantine graces as a total want of observation, memory, understanding, and interest, and an eternal disposition to fall asleep over the fire and into it, Mr. Smallweed's grandmother has undoubtedly brightened the family.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BH.c21.p3"><s sid="6" id="BH.c21.s6">Mr. Smallweed's grandfather is likewise of the party.</s> <s sid="7" id="BH.c21.s7">He is in a helpless condition as to his lower, and nearly so as to his upper, limbs, but his mind is unimpaired.</s> <s sid="8" id="BH.c21.s8">It holds, as well as it ever held, the first four rules of arithmetic and a certain small collection of the hardest facts.</s> <s sid="9" id="BH.c21.s9">In respect of ideality, reverence, wonder, and other such phrenological attributes, it is no worse off than it used to be.</s> <s sid="10" id="BH.c21.s10">Everything that Mr. Smallweed's grandfather ever put away in his mind was a grub at first, and is a grub at last.</s> <s sid="11" id="BH.c21.s11">In all his life he has never bred a single butterfly.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BH.c21.p4"><s sid="12" id="BH.c21.s12">The father of this pleasant grandfather, of the neighbourhood of Mount Pleasant, was a horny-skinned, two-legged, money-getting species of spider who spun webs to catch unwary flies and retired into holes until they were entrapped.</s> <s sid="13" id="BH.c21.s13">The name of this old pagan's god was Compound Interest.</s> <s sid="14" id="BH.c21.s14">He lived for it, married it, died of it.</s> <s sid="15" id="BH.c21.s15">Meeting with a heavy loss in an honest little enterprise in which all the loss was intended to have been on the other side, he broke something--something necessary to his existence, therefore it couldn't have been his heart--and made an end of his career.</s> <s sid="16" id="BH.c21.s16">As his character was not good, and he had been bred at a charity school in a complete course, according to question and answer, of those ancient people the Amorites and Hittites, he was frequently quoted as an example of the failure of education.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BH.c25.p1"><s sid="1" id="BH.c25.s1">There is disquietude in Cook's Court, Cursitor Street.</s> <s sid="2" id="BH.c25.s2">Black suspicion hides in that peaceful region.</s> <s sid="3" id="BH.c25.s3">The mass of Cook's Courtiers are in their usual state of mind, no better and no worse; but Mr. Snagsby is changed, and his little woman knows it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BH.c25.p2"><s sid="4" id="BH.c25.s4">For Tom-all-Alone's and Lincoln's Inn Fields persist in harnessing themselves, a pair of ungovernable coursers, to the chariot of Mr. Snagsby's imagination; and Mr. Bucket drives; and the passengers are Jo and Mr. Tulkinghorn; and the complete equipage whirls though the law-stationery business at wild speed all round the clock.</s> <s sid="5" id="BH.c25.s5">Even in the little front kitchen where the family meals are taken, it rattles away at a smoking pace from the dinner-table, when Mr. Snagsby pauses in carving the first slice of the leg of mutton baked with potatoes and stares at the kitchen wall.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BH.c25.p3"><s sid="6" id="BH.c25.s6">Mr. Snagsby cannot make out what it is that he has had to do with.</s> <s sid="7" id="BH.c25.s7">Something is wrong somewhere, but what something, what may come of it, to whom, when, and from which unthought of and unheard of quarter is the puzzle of his life.</s> <s sid="8" id="BH.c25.s8">His remote impressions of the robes and coronets, the stars and garters, that sparkle through the surface-dust of Mr. Tulkinghorn's chambers; his veneration for the mysteries presided over by that best and closest of his customers, whom all the Inns of Court, all Chancery Lane, and all the legal neighbourhood agree to hold in awe; his remembrance of Detective Mr. Bucket with his forefinger and his confidential manner, impossible to be evaded or declined, persuade him that he is a party to some dangerous secret without knowing what it is.</s> <s sid="9" id="BH.c25.s9">And it is the fearful peculiarity of this condition that, at any hour of his daily life, at any opening of the shop-door, at any pull of the bell, at any entrance of a messenger, or any delivery of a letter, the secret may take air and fire, explode, and blow up--Mr. Bucket only knows whom.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BH.c28.p5"><s sid="16" id="BH.c28.s16">Of these, foremost in the front rank stands Volumnia Dedlock, a young lady (of sixty) who is doubly highly related, having the honour to be a poor relation, by the mother's side, to another great family.</s> <s sid="17" id="BH.c28.s17">Miss Volumnia, displaying in early life a pretty talent for cutting ornaments out of coloured paper, and also for singing to the guitar in the Spanish tongue, and propounding French conundrums in country houses, passed the twenty years of her existence between twenty and forty in a sufficiently agreeable manner.</s> <s sid="18" id="BH.c28.s18">Lapsing then out of date and being considered to bore mankind by her vocal performances in the Spanish language, she retired to Bath, where she lives slenderly on an annual present from Sir Leicester and whence she makes occasional resurrections in the country houses of her cousins.</s> <s sid="19" id="BH.c28.s19">She has an extensive acquaintance at Bath among appalling old gentlemen with thin legs and nankeen trousers, and is of high standing in that dreary city.</s> <s sid="20" id="BH.c28.s20">But she is a little dreaded elsewhere in consequence of an indiscreet profusion in the article of rouge and persistency in an obsolete pearl necklace like a rosary of little bird's-eggs.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BH.c29.p2" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="BH.c29.s7">But the house in town, which is rarely in the same mind as Chesney Wold at the same time, seldom rejoicing when it rejoices or mourning when it mourns, expecting when a Dedlock dies--the house in town shines out awakened.</s> <s sid="8" id="BH.c29.s8">As warm and bright as so much state may be, as delicately redolent of pleasant scents that bear no trace of winter as hothouse flowers can make it, soft and hushed so that the ticking of the clocks and the crisp burning of the fires alone disturb the stillness in the rooms, it seems to wrap those chilled bones of Sir Leicester's in rainbow-coloured wool.</s> <s sid="9" id="BH.c29.s9">And Sir Leicester is glad to repose in dignified contentment before the great fire in the library, condescendingly perusing the backs of his books or honouring the fine arts with a glance of approbation.</s> <s sid="10" id="BH.c29.s10">For he has his pictures, ancient and modern.</s> <s sid="11" id="BH.c29.s11">Some of the Fancy Ball School in which art occasionally condescends to become a master, which would be best catalogued like the miscellaneous articles in a sale.</s> <s sid="12" id="BH.c29.s12">As <qs/>"Three high-backed chairs, a table and cover, long-necked bottle (containing wine), one flask, one Spanish female's costume, three-quarter face portrait of Miss Jogg the model, and a suit of armour containing Don Quixote."<qe/></s> <s sid="13" id="BH.c29.s13">Or <qs/>"One stone terrace (cracked), one gondola in distance, one Venetian senator's dress complete, richly embroidered white satin costume with profile portrait of Miss Jogg the model, one Scimitar superbly mounted in gold with jewelled handle, elaborate Moorish dress (very rare), and Othello."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="3" id="BH.c29.p3"><s sid="14" id="BH.c29.s14">Mr. Tulkinghorn comes and goes pretty often, there being estate business to do, leases to be renewed, and so on.</s> <s sid="15" id="BH.c29.s15">He sees my Lady pretty often, too; and he and she are as composed, and as indifferent, and take as little heed of one another, as ever.</s> <s sid="16" id="BH.c29.s16">Yet it may be that my Lady fears this Mr. Tulkinghorn and that he knows it.</s> <s sid="17" id="BH.c29.s17">It may be that he pursues her doggedly and steadily, with no touch of compunction, remorse, or pity.</s> <s sid="18" id="BH.c29.s18">It may be that her beauty and all the state and brilliancy surrounding her only gives him the greater zest for what he is set upon and makes him the more inflexible in it.</s> <s sid="19" id="BH.c29.s19">Whether he be cold and cruel, whether immovable in what he has made his duty, whether absorbed in love of power, whether determined to have nothing hidden from him in ground where he has burrowed among secrets all his life, whether he in his heart despises the splendour of which he is a distant beam, whether he is always treasuring up slights and offences in the affability of his gorgeous clients--whether he be any of this, or all of this, it may be that my Lady had better have five thousand pairs of fashionable eyes upon her, in distrustful vigilance, than the two eyes of this rusty lawyer with his wisp of neckcloth and his dull black breeches tied with ribbons at the knees.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BH.c33.p1"><s sid="1" id="BH.c33.s1">Now do those two gentlemen not very neat about the cuffs and buttons who attended the last coroner's inquest at the Sol's Arms reappear in the precincts with surprising swiftness (being, in fact, breathlessly fetched by the active and intelligent beadle), and institute perquisitions through the court, and dive into the Sol's parlour, and write with ravenous little pens on tissue-paper.</s> <s sid="2" id="BH.c33.s2">Now do they note down, in the watches of the night, how the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane was yesterday, at about midnight, thrown into a state of the most intense agitation and excitement by the following alarming and horrible discovery.</s> <s sid="3" id="BH.c33.s3">Now do they set forth how it will doubtless be remembered that some time back a painful sensation was created in the public mind by a case of mysterious death from opium occurring in the first floor of the house occupied as a rag, bottle, and general marine store shop, by an eccentric individual of intemperate habits, far advanced in life, named Krook; and how, by a remarkable coincidence, Krook was examined at the inquest, which it may be recollected was held on that occasion at the Sol's Arms, a well-conducted tavern immediately adjoining the premises in question on the west side and licensed to a highly respectable landlord, Mr. James George Bogsby.</s> <s sid="4" id="BH.c33.s4">Now do they show (in as many words as possible) how during some hours of yesterday evening a very peculiar smell was observed by the inhabitants of the court, in which the tragical occurrence which forms the subject of that present account transpired; and which odour was at one time so powerful that Mr. Swills, a comic vocalist professionally engaged by Mr. J.</s> <s sid="5" id="BH.c33.s5">G. Bogsby, has himself stated to our reporter that he mentioned to Miss M. Melvilleson, a lady of some pretensions to musical ability, likewise engaged by Mr. J.</s> <s sid="6" id="BH.c33.s6">G. Bogsby to sing at a series of concerts called Harmonic Assemblies, or Meetings, which it would appear are held at the Sol's Arms under Mr. Bogsby's direction pursuant to the Act of George the Second, that he (Mr.</s> <s sid="7" id="BH.c33.s7">Swills) found his voice seriously affected by the impure state of the atmosphere, his jocose expression at the time being that he was like an empty post-office, for he hadn't a single note in him.</s> <s sid="8" id="BH.c33.s8">How this account of Mr. Swills is entirely corroborated by two intelligent married females residing in the same court and known respectively by the names of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins, both of whom observed the foetid effluvia and regarded them as being emitted from the premises in the occupation of Krook, the unfortunate deceased.</s> <s sid="9" id="BH.c33.s9">All this and a great deal more the two gentlemen who have formed an amicable partnership in the melancholy catastrophe write down on the spot; and the boy population of the court (out of bed in a moment) swarm up the shutters of the Sol's Arms parlour, to behold the tops of their heads while they are about it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BH.c33.p2" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="BH.c33.s10">The whole court, adult as well as boy, is sleepless for that night, and can do nothing but wrap up its many heads, and talk of the ill- fated house, and look at it.</s> <s sid="11" id="BH.c33.s11">Miss Flite has been bravely rescued from her chamber, as if it were in flames, and accommodated with a bed at the Sol's Arms.</s> <s sid="12" id="BH.c33.s12">The Sol neither turns off its gas nor shuts its door all night, for any kind of public excitement makes good for the Sol and causes the court to stand in need of comfort.</s> <s sid="13" id="BH.c33.s13">The house has not done so much in the stomachic article of cloves or in brandy-and-water warm since the inquest.</s> <s sid="14" id="BH.c33.s14">The moment the pot-boy heard what had happened, he rolled up his shirt-sleeves tight to his shoulders and said, <qs/>"There'll be a run upon us!"<qe/></s> <s sid="15" id="BH.c33.s15">In the first outcry, young Piper dashed off for the fire-engines and returned in triumph at a jolting gallop perched up aloft on the Phoenix and holding on to that fabulous creature with all his might in the midst of helmets and torches.</s> <s sid="16" id="BH.c33.s16">One helmet remains behind after careful investigation of all chinks and crannies and slowly paces up and down before the house in company with one of the two policemen who have likewise been left in charge thereof.</s> <s sid="17" id="BH.c33.s17">To this trio everybody in the court possessed of sixpence has an insatiate desire to exhibit hospitality in a liquid form.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="BH.c33.p3" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="BH.c33.s18">Mr. Weevle and his friend Mr. Guppy are within the bar at the Sol and are worth anything to the Sol that the bar contains if they will only stay there.</s> <s sid="19" id="BH.c33.s19"><qs/>"This is not a time,"<qe/><sss/> says Mr. Bogsby, <sse/><qs/>"to haggle about money,"<qe/><sls/> though he looks something sharply after it, over the counter; <sle/><qs/>"give your orders, you two gentlemen, and you're welcome to whatever you put a name to."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="4" id="BH.c33.p4"><s sid="20" id="BH.c33.s20">Thus entreated, the two gentlemen (Mr.</s> <s sid="21" id="BH.c33.s21">Weevle especially) put names to so many things that in course of time they find it difficult to put a name to anything quite distinctly, though they still relate to all new-comers some version of the night they have had of it, and of what they said, and what they thought, and what they saw.</s> <s sid="22" id="BH.c33.s22">Meanwhile, one or other of the policemen often flits about the door, and pushing it open a little way at the full length of his arm, looks in from outer gloom.</s> <s sid="23" id="BH.c33.s23">Not that he has any suspicions, but that he may as well know what they are up to in there.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BH.c33.p5"><s sid="24" id="BH.c33.s24">Thus night pursues its leaden course, finding the court still out of bed through the unwonted hours, still treating and being treated, still conducting itself similarly to a court that has had a little money left it unexpectedly.</s> <s sid="25" id="BH.c33.s25">Thus night at length with slow-retreating steps departs, and the lamp-lighter going his rounds, like an executioner to a despotic king, strikes off the little heads of fire that have aspired to lessen the darkness.</s> <s sid="26" id="BH.c33.s26">Thus the day cometh, whether or no.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="BH.c33.p6"><s sid="27" id="BH.c33.s27">And the day may discern, even with its dim London eye, that the court has been up all night.</s> <s sid="28" id="BH.c33.s28">Over and above the faces that have fallen drowsily on tables and the heels that lie prone on hard floors instead of beds, the brick and mortar physiognomy of the very court itself looks worn and jaded.</s> <s sid="29" id="BH.c33.s29">And now the neighbourhood, waking up and beginning to hear of what has happened, comes streaming in, half dressed, to ask questions; and the two policemen and the helmet (who are far less impressible externally than the court) have enough to do to keep the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BH.c40.p1"><s sid="1" id="BH.c40.s1">England has been in a dreadful state for some weeks.</s> <s sid="2" id="BH.c40.s2">Lord Coodle would go out, Sir Thomas Doodle wouldn't come in, and there being nobody in Great Britain (to speak of) except Coodle and Doodle, there has been no government.</s> <s sid="3" id="BH.c40.s3">It is a mercy that the hostile meeting between those two great men, which at one time seemed inevitable, did not come off, because if both pistols had taken effect, and Coodle and Doodle had killed each other, it is to be presumed that England must have waited to be governed until young Coodle and young Doodle, now in frocks and long stockings, were grown up.</s> <s sid="4" id="BH.c40.s4">This stupendous national calamity, however, was averted by Lord Coodle's making the timely discovery that if in the heat of debate he had said that he scorned and despised the whole ignoble career of Sir Thomas Doodle, he had merely meant to say that party differences should never induce him to withhold from it the tribute of his warmest admiration; while it as opportunely turned out, on the other hand, that Sir Thomas Doodle had in his own bosom expressly booked Lord Coodle to go down to posterity as the mirror of virtue and honour.</s> <s sid="5" id="BH.c40.s5">Still England has been some weeks in the dismal strait of having no pilot (as was well observed by Sir Leicester Dedlock) to weather the storm; and the marvellous part of the matter is that England has not appeared to care very much about it, but has gone on eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage as the old world did in the days before the flood.</s> <s sid="6" id="BH.c40.s6">But Coodle knew the danger, and Doodle knew the danger, and all their followers and hangers-on had the clearest possible perception of the danger.</s> <s sid="7" id="BH.c40.s7">At last Sir Thomas Doodle has not only condescended to come in, but has done it handsomely, bringing in with him all his nephews, all his male cousins, and all his brothers-in-law.</s> <s sid="8" id="BH.c40.s8">So there is hope for the old ship yet.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BH.c40.p2"><s sid="9" id="BH.c40.s9">Doodle has found that he must throw himself upon the country, chiefly in the form of sovereigns and beer.</s> <s sid="10" id="BH.c40.s10">In this metamorphosed state he is available in a good many places simultaneously and can throw himself upon a considerable portion of the country at one time.</s> <s sid="11" id="BH.c40.s11">Britannia being much occupied in pocketing Doodle in the form of sovereigns, and swallowing Doodle in the form of beer, and in swearing herself black in the face that she does neither-- plainly to the advancement of her glory and morality--the London season comes to a sudden end, through all the Doodleites and Coodleites dispersing to assist Britannia in those religious exercises.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BH.c40.p3"><s sid="12" id="BH.c40.s12">Hence Mrs. Rouncewell, housekeeper at Chesney Wold, foresees, though no instructions have yet come down, that the family may shortly be expected, together with a pretty large accession of cousins and others who can in any way assist the great Constitutional work.</s> <s sid="13" id="BH.c40.s13">And hence the stately old dame, taking Time by the forelock, leads him up and down the staircases, and along the galleries and passages, and through the rooms, to witness before he grows any older that everything is ready, that floors are rubbed bright, carpets spread, curtains shaken out, beds puffed and patted, still-room and kitchen cleared for action--all things prepared as beseems the Dedlock dignity.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BH.c40.p4"><s sid="14" id="BH.c40.s14">This present summer evening, as the sun goes down, the preparations are complete.</s> <s sid="15" id="BH.c40.s15">Dreary and solemn the old house looks, with so many appliances of habitation and with no inhabitants except the pictured forms upon the walls.</s> <s sid="16" id="BH.c40.s16">So did these come and go, a Dedlock in possession might have ruminated passing along; so did they see this gallery hushed and quiet, as I see it now; so think, as I think, of the gap that they would make in this domain when they were gone; so find it, as I find it, difficult to believe that it could be without them; so pass from my world, as I pass from theirs, now closing the reverberating door; so leave no blank to miss them, and so die.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BH.c40.p5"><s sid="17" id="BH.c40.s17">Through some of the fiery windows beautiful from without, and set, at this sunset hour, not in dull-grey stone but in a glorious house of gold, the light excluded at other windows pours in rich, lavish, overflowing like the summer plenty in the land.</s> <s sid="18" id="BH.c40.s18">Then do the frozen Dedlocks thaw.</s> <s sid="19" id="BH.c40.s19">Strange movements come upon their features as the shadows of leaves play there.</s> <s sid="20" id="BH.c40.s20">A dense justice in a corner is beguiled into a wink.</s> <s sid="21" id="BH.c40.s21">A staring baronet, with a truncheon, gets a dimple in his chin.</s> <s sid="22" id="BH.c40.s22">Down into the bosom of a stony shepherdess there steals a fleck of light and warmth that would have done it good a hundred years ago.</s> <s sid="23" id="BH.c40.s23">One ancestress of Volumnia, in high- heeled shoes, very like her--casting the shadow of that virgin event before her full two centuries--shoots out into a halo and becomes a saint.</s> <s sid="24" id="BH.c40.s24">A maid of honour of the court of Charles the Second, with large round eyes (and other charms to correspond), seems to bathe in glowing water, and it ripples as it glows.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="BH.c40.p6"><s sid="25" id="BH.c40.s25">But the fire of the sun is dying.</s> <s sid="26" id="BH.c40.s26">Even now the floor is dusky, and shadow slowly mounts the walls, bringing the Dedlocks down like age and death.</s> <s sid="27" id="BH.c40.s27">And now, upon my Lady's picture over the great chimney- piece, a weird shade falls from some old tree, that turns it pale, and flutters it, and looks as if a great arm held a veil or hood, watching an opportunity to draw it over her.</s> <s sid="28" id="BH.c40.s28">Higher and darker rises shadow on the wall--now a red gloom on the ceiling--now the fire is out.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="BH.c40.p7"><s sid="29" id="BH.c40.s29">All that prospect, which from the terrace looked so near, has moved solemnly away and changed--not the first nor the last of beautiful things that look so near and will so change--into a distant phantom.</s> <s sid="30" id="BH.c40.s30">Light mists arise, and the dew falls, and all the sweet scents in the garden are heavy in the air.</s> <s sid="31" id="BH.c40.s31">Now the woods settle into great masses as if they were each one profound tree.</s> <s sid="32" id="BH.c40.s32">And now the moon rises to separate them, and to glimmer here and there in horizontal lines behind their stems, and to make the avenue a pavement of light among high cathedral arches fantastically broken.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="BH.c40.p8"><s sid="33" id="BH.c40.s33">Now the moon is high; and the great house, needing habitation more than ever, is like a body without life.</s> <s sid="34" id="BH.c40.s34">Now it is even awful, stealing through it, to think of the live people who have slept in the solitary bedrooms, to say nothing of the dead.</s> <s sid="35" id="BH.c40.s35">Now is the time for shadow, when every corner is a cavern and every downward step a pit, when the stained glass is reflected in pale and faded hues upon the floors, when anything and everything can be made of the heavy staircase beams excepting their own proper shapes, when the armour has dull lights upon it not easily to be distinguished from stealthy movement, and when barred helmets are frightfully suggestive of heads inside.</s> <s sid="36" id="BH.c40.s36">But of all the shadows in Chesney Wold, the shadow in the long drawing-room upon my Lady's picture is the first to come, the last to be disturbed.</s> <s sid="37" id="BH.c40.s37">At this hour and by this light it changes into threatening hands raised up and menacing the handsome face with every breath that stirs.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="BH.c40.p9" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="BH.c40.s38"><qs/>"She is not well, ma'am,"<qe/> says a groom in Mrs. Rouncewell's audience-chamber.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="BH.c40.p10" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="BH.c40.s39"><qs/>"My Lady not well!</s> <s sid="40" id="BH.c40.s40">What's the matter?"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="BH.c40.p11" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="BH.c40.s41"><qs/>"Why, my Lady has been but poorly, ma'am, since she was last here-- I don't mean with the family, ma'am, but when she was here as a bird of passage like.</s> <s sid="42" id="BH.c40.s42">My Lady has not been out much, for her, and has kept her room a good deal."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="12" id="BH.c40.p12" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="BH.c40.s43"><qs/>"Chesney Wold, Thomas,"<qe/><sls/> rejoins the housekeeper with proud complacency, <sle/><qs/>"will set my Lady up!</s> <s sid="44" id="BH.c40.s44">There is no finer air and no healthier soil in the world!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="BH.c40.p13"><s sid="45" id="BH.c40.s45">Thomas may have his own personal opinions on this subject, probably hints them in his manner of smoothing his sleek head from the nape of his neck to his temples, but he forbears to express them further and retires to the servants' hall to regale on cold meat-pie and ale.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="BH.c40.p14"><s sid="46" id="BH.c40.s46">This groom is the pilot-fish before the nobler shark.</s> <s sid="47" id="BH.c40.s47">Next evening, down come Sir Leicester and my Lady with their largest retinue, and down come the cousins and others from all the points of the compass.</s> <s sid="48" id="BH.c40.s48">Thenceforth for some weeks backward and forward rush mysterious men with no names, who fly about all those particular parts of the country on which Doodle is at present throwing himself in an auriferous and malty shower, but who are merely persons of a restless disposition and never do anything anywhere.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="BH.c40.p15"><s sid="49" id="BH.c40.s49">On these national occasions Sir Leicester finds the cousins useful.</s> <s sid="50" id="BH.c40.s50">A better man than the Honourable Bob Stables to meet the Hunt at dinner, there could not possibly be.</s> <s sid="51" id="BH.c40.s51">Better got up gentlemen than the other cousins to ride over to polling-booths and hustings here and there, and show themselves on the side of England, it would be hard to find.</s> <s sid="52" id="BH.c40.s52">Volumnia is a little dim, but she is of the true descent; and there are many who appreciate her sprightly conversation, her French conundrums so old as to have become in the cycles of time almost new again, the honour of taking the fair Dedlock in to dinner, or even the privilege of her hand in the dance.</s> <s sid="53" id="BH.c40.s53">On these national occasions dancing may be a patriotic service, and Volumnia is constantly seen hopping about for the good of an ungrateful and unpensioning country.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="BH.c40.p16"><s sid="54" id="BH.c40.s54">My Lady takes no great pains to entertain the numerous guests, and being still unwell, rarely appears until late in the day.</s> <s sid="55" id="BH.c40.s55">But at all the dismal dinners, leaden lunches, basilisk balls, and other melancholy pageants, her mere appearance is a relief.</s> <s sid="56" id="BH.c40.s56">As to Sir Leicester, he conceives it utterly impossible that anything can be wanting, in any direction, by any one who has the good fortune to be received under that roof; and in a state of sublime satisfaction, he moves among the company, a magnificent refrigerator.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="BH.c40.p17"><s sid="57" id="BH.c40.s57">Daily the cousins trot through dust and canter over roadside turf, away to hustings and polling-booths (with leather gloves and hunting-whips for the counties and kid gloves and riding-canes for the boroughs), and daily bring back reports on which Sir Leicester holds forth after dinner.</s> <s sid="58" id="BH.c40.s58">Daily the restless men who have no occupation in life present the appearance of being rather busy.</s> <s sid="59" id="BH.c40.s59">Daily Volumnia has a little cousinly talk with Sir Leicester on the state of the nation, from which Sir Leicester is disposed to conclude that Volumnia is a more reflecting woman than he had thought her.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="BH.c40.p18" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="BH.c40.s60"><qs/>"How are we getting on?"<qe/> says Miss Volumnia, clasping her hands.</s> <s sid="61" id="BH.c40.s61"><qs/>"ARE we safe?"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="BH.c40.p19"><s sid="62" id="BH.c40.s62">The mighty business is nearly over by this time, and Doodle will throw himself off the country in a few days more.</s> <s sid="63" id="BH.c40.s63">Sir Leicester has just appeared in the long drawing-room after dinner, a bright particular star surrounded by clouds of cousins.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="BH.c40.p20" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="BH.c40.s64"><qs/>"Volumnia,"<qe/><sls/> replies Sir Leicester, who has a list in his hand, <sle/><qs/>"we are doing tolerably."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="21" id="BH.c40.p21" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="BH.c40.s65"><qs/>"Only tolerably!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="22" id="BH.c40.p22" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="BH.c40.s66">Although it is summer weather, Sir Leicester always has his own particular fire in the evening.</s> <s sid="67" id="BH.c40.s67">He takes his usual screened seat near it and repeats with much firmness and a little displeasure, as who should say, I am not a common man, and when I say tolerably, it must not be understood as a common expression, <qs/>"Volumnia, we are doing tolerably."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="BH.c40.p23" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="BH.c40.s68"><qs/>"At least there is no opposition to YOU,"<qe/> Volumnia asserts with confidence.</s> </p><p pid="24" id="BH.c40.p24" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="BH.c40.s69"><qs/>"No, Volumnia.</s> <s sid="70" id="BH.c40.s70">This distracted country has lost its senses in many respects, I grieve to say, but--"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="BH.c40.p25" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="BH.c40.s71"><qs/>"It is not so mad as that.</s> <s sid="72" id="BH.c40.s72">I am glad to hear it!"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="26" id="BH.c40.p26" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="BH.c40.s73">Volumnia's finishing the sentence restores her to favour.</s> <s sid="74" id="BH.c40.s74">Sir Leicester, with a gracious inclination of his head, seems to say to himself, <qs/>"A sensible woman this, on the whole, though occasionally precipitate."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="27" id="BH.c40.p27" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="BH.c40.s75">In fact, as to this question of opposition, the fair Dedlock's observation was superfluous, Sir Leicester on these occasions always delivering in his own candidateship, as a kind of handsome wholesale order to be promptly executed.</s> <s sid="76" id="BH.c40.s76">Two other little seats that belong to him he treats as retail orders of less importance, merely sending down the men and signifying to the tradespeople, <qs/>"You will have the goodness to make these materials into two members of Parliament and to send them home when done."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="28" id="BH.c40.p28" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="BH.c40.s77"><qs/>"I regret to say, Volumnia, that in many places the people have shown a bad spirit, and that this opposition to the government has been of a most determined and most implacable description."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="29" id="BH.c40.p29" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="BH.c40.s78"><qs/>"W-r-retches!"<qe/> says Volumnia.</s> </p><p pid="30" id="BH.c40.p30" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="BH.c40.s79"><qs/>"Even,"<qe/><sls/> proceeds Sir Leicester, glancing at the circumjacent cousins on sofas and ottomans, <sle/><qs/>"even in many--in fact, in most--of those places in which the government has carried it against a faction--"<qe/></s> </p><p pid="31" id="BH.c40.p31"><s sid="80" id="BH.c40.s80">(Note, by the way, that the Coodleites are always a faction with the Doodleites, and that the Doodleites occupy exactly the same position towards the Coodleites.)</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="BH.c43.p22"><s sid="73" id="BH.c43.s73">He lived in a place called the Polygon, in Somers Town, where there were at that time a number of poor Spanish refugees walking about in cloaks, smoking little paper cigars.</s> <s sid="74" id="BH.c43.s74">Whether he was a better tenant than one might have supposed, in consequence of his friend Somebody always paying his rent at last, or whether his inaptitude for business rendered it particularly difficult to turn him out, I don't know; but he had occupied the same house some years.</s> <s sid="75" id="BH.c43.s75">It was in a state of dilapidation quite equal to our expectation.</s> <s sid="76" id="BH.c43.s76">Two or three of the area railings were gone, the water-butt was broken, the knocker was loose, the bell-handle had been pulled off a long time to judge from the rusty state of the wire, and dirty footprints on the steps were the only signs of its being inhabited.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="BH.c43.p23"><s sid="77" id="BH.c43.s77">A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry answered our knock by opening the door a very little way and stopping up the gap with her figure.</s> <s sid="78" id="BH.c43.s78">As she knew Mr. Jarndyce (indeed Ada and I both thought that she evidently associated him with the receipt of her wages), she immediately relented and allowed us to pass in.</s> <s sid="79" id="BH.c43.s79">The lock of the door being in a disabled condition, she then applied herself to securing it with the chain, which was not in good action either, and said would we go upstairs?</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="BH.c43.p24"><s sid="80" id="BH.c43.s80">We went upstairs to the first floor, still seeing no other furniture than the dirty footprints.</s> <s sid="81" id="BH.c43.s81">Mr. Jarndyce without further ceremony entered a room there, and we followed.</s> <s sid="82" id="BH.c43.s82">It was dingy enough and not at all clean, but furnished with an odd kind of shabby luxury, with a large footstool, a sofa, and plenty of cushions, an easy-chair, and plenty of pillows, a piano, books, drawing materials, music, newspapers, and a few sketches and pictures.</s> <s sid="83" id="BH.c43.s83">A broken pane of glass in one of the dirty windows was papered and wafered over, but there was a little plate of hothouse nectarines on the table, and there was another of grapes, and another of sponge-cakes, and there was a bottle of light wine.</s> <s sid="84" id="BH.c43.s84">Mr. Skimpole himself reclined upon the sofa in a dressing-gown, drinking some fragrant coffee from an old china cup--it was then about mid-day--and looking at a collection of wallflowers in the balcony.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BH.c52.p1"><s sid="1" id="BH.c52.s1">But one other day had intervened when, early in the morning as we were going to breakfast, Mr. Woodcourt came in haste with the astounding news that a terrible murder had been committed for which Mr. George had been apprehended and was in custody.</s> <s sid="2" id="BH.c52.s2">When he told us that a large reward was offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock for the murderer's apprehension, I did not in my first consternation understand why; but a few more words explained to me that the murdered person was Sir Leicester's lawyer, and immediately my mother's dread of him rushed into my remembrance.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BH.c52.p2"><s sid="3" id="BH.c52.s3">This unforeseen and violent removal of one whom she had long watched and distrusted and who had long watched and distrusted her, one for whom she could have had few intervals of kindness, always dreading in him a dangerous and secret enemy, appeared so awful that my first thoughts were of her.</s> <s sid="4" id="BH.c52.s4">How appalling to hear of such a death and be able to feel no pity!</s> <s sid="5" id="BH.c52.s5">How dreadful to remember, perhaps, that she had sometimes even wished the old man away who was so swiftly hurried out of life!</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BH.c52.p3"><s sid="6" id="BH.c52.s6">Such crowding reflections, increasing the distress and fear I always felt when the name was mentioned, made me so agitated that I could scarcely hold my place at the table.</s> <s sid="7" id="BH.c52.s7">I was quite unable to follow the conversation until I had had a little time to recover.</s> <s sid="8" id="BH.c52.s8">But when I came to myself and saw how shocked my guardian was and found that they were earnestly speaking of the suspected man and recalling every favourable impression we had formed of him out of the good we had known of him, my interest and my fears were so strongly aroused in his behalf that I was quite set up again.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="BH.c52.p14"><s sid="43" id="BH.c52.s43">When he saw us, he came forward a step with his usual heavy tread, and there stopped and made a slight bow.</s> <s sid="44" id="BH.c52.s44">But as I still advanced, putting out my hand to him, he understood us in a moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BH.c64.p4"><s sid="15" id="BH.c64.s15">Of course this was not a time to neglect my guardian, and of course it was not a time for neglecting my darling.</s> <s sid="16" id="BH.c64.s16">So I had plenty of occupation, which I was glad of; and as to Charley, she was absolutely not to be seen for needlework.</s> <s sid="17" id="BH.c64.s17">To surround herself with great heaps of it--baskets full and tables full--and do a little, and spend a great deal of time in staring with her round eyes at what there was to do, and persuade herself that she was going to do it, were Charley's great dignities and delights.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BH.c64.p5"><s sid="18" id="BH.c64.s18">Meanwhile, I must say, I could not agree with my guardian on the subject of the will, and I had some sanguine hopes of Jarndyce and Jarndyce.</s> <s sid="19" id="BH.c64.s19">Which of us was right will soon appear, but I certainly did encourage expectations.</s> <s sid="20" id="BH.c64.s20">In Richard, the discovery gave occasion for a burst of business and agitation that buoyed him up for a little time, but he had lost the elasticity even of hope now and seemed to me to retain only its feverish anxieties.</s> <s sid="21" id="BH.c64.s21">From something my guardian said one day when we were talking about this, I understood that my marriage would not take place until after the term-time we had been told to look forward to; and I thought the more, for that, how rejoiced I should be if I could be married when Richard and Ada were a little more prosperous.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="BH.c64.p6"><s sid="22" id="BH.c64.s22">The term was very near indeed when my guardian was called out of town and went down into Yorkshire on Mr. Woodcourt's business.</s> <s sid="23" id="BH.c64.s23">He had told me beforehand that his presence there would be necessary.</s> <s sid="24" id="BH.c64.s24">I had just come in one night from my dear girl's and was sitting in the midst of all my new clothes, looking at them all around me and thinking, when a letter from my guardian was brought to me.</s> <s sid="25" id="BH.c64.s25">It asked me to join him in the country and mentioned by what stage- coach my place was taken and at what time in the morning I should have to leave town.</s> <s sid="26" id="BH.c64.s26">It added in a postscript that I would not be many hours from Ada.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="BH.c64.p8"><s sid="29" id="BH.c64.s29">It was night when I came to my journey's end and found my guardian waiting for me.</s> <s sid="30" id="BH.c64.s30">This was a great relief, for towards evening I had begun to fear (the more so as his letter was a very short one) that he might be ill.  However, there he was, as well as it was possible to be; and when I saw his genial face again at its brightest and best, I said to myself, he has been doing some other great kindness.</s> <s sid="31" id="BH.c64.s31">Not that it required much penetration to say that, because I knew that his being there at all was an act of kindness.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER LXVI Down in Lincolnshire</title>

<p pid="1" id="BH.c66.p1"><s sid="1" id="BH.c66.s1">There is a hush upon Chesney Wold in these altered days, as there is upon a portion of the family history.</s> <s sid="2" id="BH.c66.s2">The story goes that Sir Leicester paid some who could have spoken out to hold their peace; but it is a lame story, feebly whispering and creeping about, and any brighter spark of life it shows soon dies away.</s> <s sid="3" id="BH.c66.s3">It is known for certain that the handsome Lady Dedlock lies in the mausoleum in the park, where the trees arch darkly overhead, and the owl is heard at night making the woods ring; but whence she was brought home to be laid among the echoes of that solitary place, or how she died, is all mystery.</s> <s sid="4" id="BH.c66.s4">Some of her old friends, principally to be found among the peachy-cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats, did once occasionally say, as they toyed in a ghastly manner with large fans--like charmers reduced to flirting with grim death, after losing all their other beaux--did once occasionally say, when the world assembled together, that they wondered the ashes of the Dedlocks, entombed in the mausoleum, never rose against the profanation of her company.</s> <s sid="5" id="BH.c66.s5">But the dead-and-gone Dedlocks take it very calmly and have never been known to object.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BH.c66.p2"><s sid="6" id="BH.c66.s6">Up from among the fern in the hollow, and winding by the bridle- road among the trees, comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of horses' hoofs.</s> <s sid="7" id="BH.c66.s7">Then may be seen Sir Leicester--invalided, bent, and almost blind, but of worthy presence yet--riding with a stalwart man beside him, constant to his bridle-rein.</s> <s sid="8" id="BH.c66.s8">When they come to a certain spot before the mausoleum-door, Sir Leicester's accustomed horse stops of his own accord, and Sir Leicester, pulling off his hat, is still for a few moments before they ride away.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BH.c66.p3"><s sid="9" id="BH.c66.s9">War rages yet with the audacious Boythorn, though at uncertain intervals, and now hotly, and now coolly, flickering like an unsteady fire.</s> <s sid="10" id="BH.c66.s10">The truth is said to be that when Sir Leicester came down to Lincolnshire for good, Mr. Boythorn showed a manifest desire to abandon his right of way and do whatever Sir Leicester would, which Sir Leicester, conceiving to be a condescension to his illness or misfortune, took in such high dudgeon, and was so magnificently aggrieved by, that Mr. Boythorn found himself under the necessity of committing a flagrant trespass to restore his neighbour to himself.</s> <s sid="11" id="BH.c66.s11">Similarly, Mr. Boythorn continues to post tremendous placards on the disputed thoroughfare and (with his bird upon his head) to hold forth vehemently against Sir Leicester in the sanctuary of his own home; similarly, also, he defies him as of old in the little church by testifying a bland unconsciousness of his existence.</s> <s sid="12" id="BH.c66.s12">But it is whispered that when he is most ferocious towards his old foe, he is really most considerate, and that Sir Leicester, in the dignity of being implacable, little supposes how much he is humoured.</s> <s sid="13" id="BH.c66.s13">As little does he think how near together he and his antagonist have suffered in the fortunes of two sisters, and his antagonist, who knows it now, is not the man to tell him.</s> <s sid="14" id="BH.c66.s14">So the quarrel goes on to the satisfaction of both.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BH.c66.p4"><s sid="15" id="BH.c66.s15">In one of the lodges of the park--that lodge within sight of the house where, once upon a time, when the waters were out down in Lincolnshire, my Lady used to see the keeper's child--the stalwart man, the trooper formerly, is housed.</s> <s sid="16" id="BH.c66.s16">Some relics of his old calling hang upon the walls, and these it is the chosen recreation of a little lame man about the stable-yard to keep gleaming bright.</s> <s sid="17" id="BH.c66.s17">A busy little man he always is, in the polishing at harness-house doors, of stirrup-irons, bits, curb-chains, harness bosses, anything in the way of a stable-yard that will take a polish, leading a life of friction.</s> <s sid="18" id="BH.c66.s18">A shaggy little damaged man, withal, not unlike an old dog of some mongrel breed, who has been considerably knocked about.</s> <s sid="19" id="BH.c66.s19">He answers to the name of Phil.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BH.c66.p5" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="BH.c66.s20">A goodly sight it is to see the grand old housekeeper (harder of hearing now) going to church on the arm of her son and to observe-- which few do, for the house is scant of company in these times--the relations of both towards Sir Leicester, and his towards them.</s> <s sid="21" id="BH.c66.s21">They have visitors in the high summer weather, when a grey cloak and umbrella, unknown to Chesney Wold at other periods, are seen among the leaves; when two young ladies are occasionally found gambolling in sequestered saw-pits and such nooks of the park; and when the smoke of two pipes wreathes away into the fragrant evening air from the trooper's door.</s> <s sid="22" id="BH.c66.s22">Then is a fife heard trolling within the lodge on the inspiring topic of the "British Grenadiers"; and as the evening closes in, a gruff inflexible voice is heard to say, while two men pace together up and down, <qs/>"But I never own to it before the old girl.</s> <s sid="23" id="BH.c66.s23">Discipline must be maintained."<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="BH.c66.p6"><s sid="24" id="BH.c66.s24">The greater part of the house is shut up, and it is a show-house no longer; yet Sir Leicester holds his shrunken state in the long drawing-room for all that, and reposes in his old place before my Lady's picture.</s> <s sid="25" id="BH.c66.s25">Closed in by night with broad screens, and illumined only in that part, the light of the drawing-room seems gradually contracting and dwindling until it shall be no more.</s> <s sid="26" id="BH.c66.s26">A little more, in truth, and it will be all extinguished for Sir Leicester; and the damp door in the mausoleum which shuts so tight, and looks so obdurate, will have opened and received him.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="BH.c66.p7"><s sid="27" id="BH.c66.s27">Volumnia, growing with the flight of time pinker as to the red in her face, and yellower as to the white, reads to Sir Leicester in the long evenings and is driven to various artifices to conceal her yawns, of which the chief and most efficacious is the insertion of the pearl necklace between her rosy lips.</s> <s sid="28" id="BH.c66.s28">Long-winded treatises on the Buffy and Boodle question, showing how Buffy is immaculate and Boodle villainous, and how the country is lost by being all Boodle and no Buffy, or saved by being all Buffy and no Boodle (it must be one of the two, and cannot be anything else), are the staple of her reading.</s> <s sid="29" id="BH.c66.s29">Sir Leicester is not particular what it is and does not appear to follow it very closely, further than that he always comes broad awake the moment Volumnia ventures to leave off, and sonorously repeating her last words, begs with some displeasure to know if she finds herself fatigued.</s> <s sid="30" id="BH.c66.s30">However, Volumnia, in the course of her bird-like hopping about and pecking at papers, has alighted on a memorandum concerning herself in the event of "anything happening" to her kinsman, which is handsome compensation for an extensive course of reading and holds even the dragon Boredom at bay.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="BH.c66.p8"><s sid="31" id="BH.c66.s31">The cousins generally are rather shy of Chesney Wold in its dullness, but take to it a little in the shooting season, when guns are heard in the plantations, and a few scattered beaters and keepers wait at the old places of appointment for low-spirited twos and threes of cousins.</s> <s sid="32" id="BH.c66.s32">The debilitated cousin, more debilitated by the dreariness of the place, gets into a fearful state of depression, groaning under penitential sofa-pillows in his gunless hours and protesting that such fernal old jail's--nough t'sew fler up--frever.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="BH.c66.p9"><s sid="33" id="BH.c66.s33">The only great occasions for Volumnia in this changed aspect of the place in Lincolnshire are those occasions, rare and widely separated, when something is to be done for the county or the country in the way of gracing a public ball.</s> <s sid="34" id="BH.c66.s34">Then, indeed, does the tuckered sylph come out in fairy form and proceed with joy under cousinly escort to the exhausted old assembly-room, fourteen heavy miles off, which, during three hundred and sixty-four days and nights of every ordinary year, is a kind of antipodean lumber- room full of old chairs and tables upside down.</s> <s sid="35" id="BH.c66.s35">Then, indeed, does she captivate all hearts by her condescension, by her girlish vivacity, and by her skipping about as in the days when the hideous old general with the mouth too full of teeth had not cut one of them at two guineas each.</s> <s sid="36" id="BH.c66.s36">Then does she twirl and twine, a pastoral nymph of good family, through the mazes of the dance.</s> <s sid="37" id="BH.c66.s37">Then do the swains appear with tea, with lemonade, with sandwiches, with homage.</s> <s sid="38" id="BH.c66.s38">Then is she kind and cruel, stately and unassuming, various, beautifully wilful.</s> <s sid="39" id="BH.c66.s39">Then is there a singular kind of parallel between her and the little glass chandeliers of another age embellishing that assembly-room, which, with their meagre stems, their spare little drops, their disappointing knobs where no drops are, their bare little stalks from which knobs and drops have both departed, and their little feeble prismatic twinkling, all seem Volumnias.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="BH.c66.p10"><s sid="40" id="BH.c66.s40">For the rest, Lincolnshire life to Volumnia is a vast blank of overgrown house looking out upon trees, sighing, wringing their hands, bowing their heads, and casting their tears upon the window- panes in monotonous depressions.</s> <s sid="41" id="BH.c66.s41">A labyrinth of grandeur, less the property of an old family of human beings and their ghostly likenesses than of an old family of echoings and thunderings which start out of their hundred graves at every sound and go resounding through the building.</s> <s sid="42" id="BH.c66.s42">A waste of unused passages and staircases in which to drop a comb upon a bedroom floor at night is to send a stealthy footfall on an errand through the house.</s> <s sid="43" id="BH.c66.s43">A place where few people care to go about alone, where a maid screams if an ash drops from the fire, takes to crying at all times and seasons, becomes the victim of a low disorder of the spirits, and gives warning and departs.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="BH.c66.p11"><s sid="44" id="BH.c66.s44">Thus Chesney Wold.</s> <s sid="45" id="BH.c66.s45">With so much of itself abandoned to darkness and vacancy; with so little change under the summer shining or the wintry lowering; so sombre and motionless always--no flag flying now by day, no rows of lights sparkling by night; with no family to come and go, no visitors to be the souls of pale cold shapes of rooms, no stir of life about it--passion and pride, even to the stranger's eye, have died away from the place in Lincolnshire and yielded it to dull repose.</s> </p></div>
