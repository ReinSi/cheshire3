<stru>PREFACE TO THE 1857 EDITION





I have been occupied with this story, during many working hours of

two years.  I must have been very ill employed, if I could not

leave its merits and demerits as a whole, to express themselves on

its being read as a whole.  But, as it is not unreasonable to

suppose that I may have held its threads with a more continuous

attention than anyone else can have given them during its desultory

publication, it is not unreasonable to ask that the weaving may be

looked at in its completed state, and with the pattern finished.



If I might offer any apology for so exaggerated a fiction as the

Barnacles and the Circumlocution Office, I would seek it in the

common experience of an Englishman, without presuming to mention

the unimportant fact of my having done that violence to good

manners, in the days of a Russian war, and of a Court of Inquiry at

Chelsea.  If I might make so bold as to defend that extravagant

conception, Mr Merdle, I would hint that it originated after the

Railroad-share epoch, in the times of a certain Irish bank, and of

one or two other equally laudable enterprises.  If I were to plead

anything in mitigation of the preposterous fancy that a bad design

will sometimes claim to be a good and an expressly religious

design, it would be the curious coincidence that it has been

brought to its climax in these pages, in the days of the public

examination of late Directors of a Royal British Bank.  But, I

submit myself to suffer judgment to go by default on all these

counts, if need be, and to accept the assurance (on good authority)

that nothing like them was ever known in this land.

Some of my readers may have an interest in being informed whether

or no any portions of the Marshalsea Prison are yet standing.  I

did not know, myself, until the sixth of this present month, when

I went to look.  I found the outer front courtyard, often mentioned

here, metamorphosed into a butter shop; and I then almost gave up

every brick of the jail for lost.  Wandering, however, down a

certain adjacent 'Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey', I came to

'Marshalsea Place:' the houses in which I recognised, not only as

the great block of the former prison, but as preserving the rooms

that arose in my mind's-eye when I became Little Dorrit's

biographer.  The smallest boy I ever conversed with, carrying the

largest baby I ever saw, offered a supernaturally intelligent

explanation of the locality in its old uses, and was very nearly

correct.  How this young Newton (for such I judge him to be) came

by his information, I don't know; he was a quarter of a century too

young to know anything about it of himself.  I pointed to the

window of the room where Little Dorrit was born, and where her

father lived so long, and asked him what was the name of the lodger

who tenanted that apartment at present?  He said, 'Tom Pythick.' 

I asked him who was Tom Pythick?  and he said, 'Joe Pythick's

uncle.'



A little further on, I found the older and smaller wall, which used

to enclose the pent-up inner prison where nobody was put, except

for ceremony.  But, whosoever goes into Marshalsea Place, turning

out of Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey, will find his feet on

the very paving-stones of the extinct Marshalsea jail; will see its

narrow yard to the right and to the left, very little altered if at

all, except that the walls were lowered when the place got free;

will look upon rooms in which the debtors lived; and will stand

among the crowding ghosts of many miserable years.



In the Preface to Bleak House I remarked that I had never had so

many readers.  In the Preface to its next successor, Little Dorrit,

I have still to repeat the same words.  Deeply sensible of the

affection and confidence that have grown up between us, I add to

this Preface, as I added to that, May we meet again!

<title>CHAPTER 1 Sun and Shadow</title>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c1.s1">Thirty years ago, Marseilles lay burning in the sun, one day.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="ld.c1.s2">A blazing sun upon a fierce August day was no greater rarity in southern France then, than at any other time, before or since.</s> <s sid="3" id="ld.c1.s3">Everything in Marseilles, and about Marseilles, had stared at the fervid sky, and been stared at in return, until a staring habit had become universal there.</s> <s sid="4" id="ld.c1.s4">Strangers were stared out of countenance by staring white houses, staring white walls, staring white streets, staring tracts of arid road, staring hills from which verdure was burnt away.</s> <s sid="5" id="ld.c1.s5">The only things to be seen not fixedly staring and glaring were the vines drooping under their load of grapes.</s> <s sid="6" id="ld.c1.s6">These did occasionally wink a little, as the hot air barely moved their faint leaves.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ld.c1.p3"><s sid="7" id="ld.c1.s7">There was no wind to make a ripple on the foul water within the harbour, or on the beautiful sea without.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c1.s8">The line of demarcation between the two colours, black and blue, showed the point which the pure sea would not pass; but it lay as quiet as the abominable pool, with which it never mixed.</s> <s sid="9" id="ld.c1.s9">Boats without awnings were too hot to touch; ships blistered at their moorings; the stones of the quays had not cooled, night or day, for months.</s> <s sid="10" id="ld.c1.s10">Hindoos, Russians, Chinese, Spaniards, Portuguese, Englishmen, Frenchmen, Genoese, Neapolitans, Venetians, Greeks, Turks, descendants from all the builders of Babel, come to trade at Marseilles, sought the shade alike--taking refuge in any hiding-place from a sea too intensely blue to be looked at, and a sky of purple, set with one great flaming jewel of fire.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="ld.c1.p4"><s sid="11" id="ld.c1.s11">The universal stare made the eyes ache.</s> <s sid="12" id="ld.c1.s12">Towards the distant line of Italian coast, indeed, it was a little relieved by light clouds of mist, slowly rising from the evaporation of the sea, but it softened nowhere else.</s> <s sid="13" id="ld.c1.s13">Far away the staring roads, deep in dust, stared from the hill-side, stared from the hollow, stared from the interminable plain.</s> <s sid="14" id="ld.c1.s14">Far away the dusty vines overhanging wayside cottages, and the monotonous wayside avenues of parched trees without shade, drooped beneath the stare of earth and sky.</s> <s sid="15" id="ld.c1.s15">So did the horses with drowsy bells, in long files of carts, creeping slowly towards the interior; so did their recumbent drivers, when they were awake, which rarely happened; so did the exhausted labourers in the fields.</s> <s sid="16" id="ld.c1.s16">Everything that lived or grew, was oppressed by the glare; except the lizard, passing swiftly over rough stone walls, and the cicala, chirping his dry hot chirp, like a rattle.</s> <s sid="17" id="ld.c1.s17">The very dust was scorched brown, and something quivered in the atmosphere as if the air itself were panting.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="ld.c1.p5"><s sid="18" id="ld.c1.s18">Blinds, shutters, curtains, awnings, were all closed and drawn to keep out the stare.</s> <s sid="19" id="ld.c1.s19">Grant it but a chink or keyhole, and it shot in like a white-hot arrow.</s> <s sid="20" id="ld.c1.s20">The churches were the freest from it.</s> <s sid="21" id="ld.c1.s21">To come out of the twilight of pillars and arches--dreamily dotted with winking lamps, dreamily peopled with ugly old shadows piously dozing, spitting, and begging--was to plunge into a fiery river, and swim for life to the nearest strip of shade.</s> <s sid="22" id="ld.c1.s22">So, with people lounging and lying wherever shade was, with but little hum of tongues or barking of dogs, with occasional jangling of discordant church bells and rattling of vicious drums, Marseilles, a fact to be strongly smelt and tasted, lay broiling in the sun one day.</s> <s sid="23" id="ld.c1.s23">In Marseilles that day there was a villainous prison.</s> <s sid="24" id="ld.c1.s24">In one of its chambers, so repulsive a place that even the obtrusive stare blinked at it, and left it to such refuse of reflected light as it could find for itself, were two men.</s> <s sid="25" id="ld.c1.s25">Besides the two men, a notched and disfigured bench, immovable from the wall, with a draught-board rudely hacked upon it with a knife, a set of draughts, made of old buttons and soup bones, a set of dominoes, two mats, and two or three wine bottles.</s> <s sid="26" id="ld.c1.s26">That was all the chamber held, exclusive of rats and other unseen vermin, in addition to the seen vermin, the two men.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="ld.c1.p6"><s sid="27" id="ld.c1.s27">It received such light as it got through a grating of iron bars fashioned like a pretty large window, by means of which it could be always inspected from the gloomy staircase on which the grating gave.</s> <s sid="28" id="ld.c1.s28">There was a broad strong ledge of stone to this grating where the bottom of it was let into the masonry, three or four feet above the ground.</s> <s sid="29" id="ld.c1.s29">Upon it, one of the two men lolled, half sitting and half lying, with his knees drawn up, and his feet and shoulders planted against the opposite sides of the aperture.</s> <s sid="30" id="ld.c1.s30">The bars were wide enough apart to admit of his thrusting his arm through to the elbow; and so he held on negligently, for his greater ease.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="ld.c1.p7"><s sid="31" id="ld.c1.s31">A prison taint was on everything there.</s> <s sid="32" id="ld.c1.s32">The imprisoned air, the imprisoned light, the imprisoned damps, the imprisoned men, were all deteriorated by confinement.</s> <s sid="33" id="ld.c1.s33">As the captive men were faded and haggard, so the iron was rusty, the stone was slimy, the wood was rotten, the air was faint, the light was dim.</s> <s sid="34" id="ld.c1.s34">Like a well, like a vault, like a tomb, the prison had no knowledge of the brightness outside, and would have kept its polluted atmosphere intact in one of the spice islands of the Indian ocean.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="ld.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="ld.c1.s35">The man who lay on the ledge of the grating was even chilled.</s> <s sid="36" id="ld.c1.s36">He jerked his great cloak more heavily upon him by an impatient movement of one shoulder, and growled, <qs/>'To the devil with this Brigand of a Sun that never shines in here!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="9" id="ld.c1.p9"><s sid="37" id="ld.c1.s37">He was waiting to be fed, looking sideways through the bars that he might see the further down the stairs, with much of the expression of a wild beast in similar expectation.</s> <s sid="38" id="ld.c1.s38">But his eyes, too close together, were not so nobly set in his head as those of the king of beasts are in his, and they were sharp rather than bright--pointed weapons with little surface to betray them.</s> <s sid="39" id="ld.c1.s39">They had no depth or change; they glittered, and they opened and shut.</s> <s sid="40" id="ld.c1.s40">So far, and waiving their use to himself, a clockmaker could have made a better pair.</s> <s sid="41" id="ld.c1.s41">He had a hook nose, handsome after its kind, but too high between the eyes by probably just as much as his eyes were too near to one another.</s> <s sid="42" id="ld.c1.s42">For the rest, he was large and tall in frame, had thin lips, where his thick moustache showed them at all, and a quantity of dry hair, of no definable colour, in its shaggy state, but shot with red.</s> <s sid="43" id="ld.c1.s43">The hand with which he held the grating (seamed all over the back with ugly scratches newly healed), was unusually small and plump; would have been unusually white but for the prison grime.</s> <s sid="44" id="ld.c1.s44">The other man was lying on the stone floor, covered with a coarse brown coat.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="ld.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="ld.c1.s45"><qs/>'Get up, pig!'<qe/> growled the first.</s> <s sid="46" id="ld.c1.s46"><qs/>'Don't sleep when I am hungry.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="ld.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="ld.c1.s47"><qs/>'It's all one, master,'<qe/><sls/> said the pig, in a submissive manner, and not without cheerfulness; <sle/><qs/>'I can wake when I will, I can sleep when I will.</s> <s sid="48" id="ld.c1.s48">It's all the same.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="12" id="ld.c1.p12"><s sid="49" id="ld.c1.s49">As he said it, he rose, shook himself, scratched himself, tied his brown coat loosely round his neck by the sleeves (he had previously used it as a coverlet), and sat down upon the pavement yawning, with his back against the wall opposite to the grating.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="ld.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="ld.c1.s50"><qs/>'Say what the hour is,'<qe/> grumbled the first man.</s> </p><p pid="14" id="ld.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="ld.c1.s51"><qs/>'The mid-day bells will ring--in forty minutes.'<qe/></s> <s sid="52" id="ld.c1.s52">When he made the little pause, he had looked round the prison-room, as if for certain information.</s> </p><p pid="15" id="ld.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="ld.c1.s53"><qs/>'You are a clock.</s> <s sid="54" id="ld.c1.s54">How is it that you always know?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="16" id="ld.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="ld.c1.s55"><qs/>'How can I say?</s> <s sid="56" id="ld.c1.s56">I always know what the hour is, and where I am.</s> <s sid="57" id="ld.c1.s57">I was brought in here at night, and out of a boat, but I know where I am.</s> <s sid="58" id="ld.c1.s58">See here!</s> <s sid="59" id="ld.c1.s59">Marseilles harbour;' on his knees on the pavement, mapping it all out with a swarthy forefinger; 'Toulon (where the galleys are), Spain over there, Algiers over there.</s> <s sid="60" id="ld.c1.s60">Creeping away to the left here, Nice.</s> <s sid="61" id="ld.c1.s61">Round by the Cornice to Genoa.</s> <s sid="62" id="ld.c1.s62">Genoa Mole and Harbour.</s> <s sid="63" id="ld.c1.s63">Quarantine Ground.</s> <s sid="64" id="ld.c1.s64">City there; terrace gardens blushing with the bella donna.</s> <s sid="65" id="ld.c1.s65">Here, Porto Fino.</s> <s sid="66" id="ld.c1.s66">Stand out for Leghorn.</s> <s sid="67" id="ld.c1.s67">Out again for Civita Vecchia.  so away to-- hey!  there's no room for Naples;'<qe/><sls/> he had got to the wall by this time; <sle/><qs/>'but it's all one; it's in there!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="17" id="ld.c1.p17"><s sid="68" id="ld.c1.s68">He remained on his knees, looking up at his fellow-prisoner with a lively look for a prison.</s> <s sid="69" id="ld.c1.s69">A sunburnt, quick, lithe, little man, though rather thickset.</s> <s sid="70" id="ld.c1.s70">Earrings in his brown ears, white teeth lighting up his grotesque brown face, intensely black hair clustering about his brown throat, a ragged red shirt open at his brown breast.</s> <s sid="71" id="ld.c1.s71">Loose, seaman-like trousers, decent shoes, a long red cap, a red sash round his waist, and a knife in it.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="ld.c1.p20"><s sid="77" id="ld.c1.s77">Some lock below gurgled in its throat immediately afterwards, and then a door crashed.</s> <s sid="78" id="ld.c1.s78">Slow steps began ascending the stairs; the prattle of a sweet little voice mingled with the noise they made; and the prison-keeper appeared carrying his daughter, three or four years old, and a basket.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="ld.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="ld.c1.s79"><qs/>'How goes the world this forenoon, gentlemen?</s> <s sid="80" id="ld.c1.s80">My little one, you see, going round with me to have a peep at her father's birds.</s> <s sid="81" id="ld.c1.s81">Fie, then!</s> <s sid="82" id="ld.c1.s82">Look at the birds, my pretty, look at the birds.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="22" id="ld.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="ld.c1.s83">He looked sharply at the birds himself, as he held the child up at the grate, especially at the little bird, whose activity he seemed to mistrust.</s> <s sid="84" id="ld.c1.s84"><qs/>'I have brought your bread, Signor John Baptist,'<qe/><sls/> said he (they all spoke in French, but the little man was an Italian); <sle/><qs/>'and if I might recommend you not to game--'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="ld.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="ld.c1.s85"><qs/>'You don't recommend the master!'<qe/> said John Baptist, showing his teeth as he smiled.</s> </p><p pid="24" id="ld.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="ld.c1.s86"><qs/>'Oh!  but the master wins,'<qe/><sls/> returned the jailer, with a passing look of no particular liking at the other man, <sle/><qs/>'and you lose.</s> <s sid="87" id="ld.c1.s87">It's quite another thing.</s> <s sid="88" id="ld.c1.s88">You get husky bread and sour drink by it; and he gets sausage of Lyons, veal in savoury jelly, white bread, strachino cheese, and good wine by it.</s> <s sid="89" id="ld.c1.s89">Look at the birds, my pretty!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="ld.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="ld.c1.s90"><qs/>'Poor birds!'<qe/> said the child.</s> </p><p pid="26" id="ld.c1.p26"><s sid="91" id="ld.c1.s91">The fair little face, touched with divine compassion, as it peeped shrinkingly through the grate, was like an angel's in the prison.</s> <s sid="92" id="ld.c1.s92">John Baptist rose and moved towards it, as if it had a good attraction for him.</s> <s sid="93" id="ld.c1.s93">The other bird remained as before, except for an impatient glance at the basket.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="ld.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="ld.c1.s94"><qs/>'Stay!'<qe/><sls/> said the jailer, putting his little daughter on the outer ledge of the grate, <sle/><qs/>'she shall feed the birds.</s> <s sid="95" id="ld.c1.s95">This big loaf is for Signor John Baptist.</s> <s sid="96" id="ld.c1.s96">We must break it to get it through into the cage.</s> <s sid="97" id="ld.c1.s97">So, there's a tame bird to kiss the little hand!</s> <s sid="98" id="ld.c1.s98">This sausage in a vine leaf is for Monsieur Rigaud.</s> <s sid="99" id="ld.c1.s99">Again--this veal in savoury jelly is for Monsieur Rigaud.</s> <s sid="100" id="ld.c1.s100">Again--these three white little loaves are for Monsieur Rigaud.</s> <s sid="101" id="ld.c1.s101">Again, this cheese--again, this wine--again, this tobacco--all for Monsieur Rigaud.</s> <s sid="102" id="ld.c1.s102">Lucky bird!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="28" id="ld.c1.p28"><s sid="103" id="ld.c1.s103">The child put all these things between the bars into the soft, Smooth, well-shaped hand, with evident dread--more than once drawing back her own and looking at the man with her fair brow roughened into an expression half of fright and half of anger.</s> <s sid="104" id="ld.c1.s104">Whereas she had put the lump of coarse bread into the swart, scaled, knotted hands of John Baptist (who had scarcely as much nail on his eight fingers and two thumbs as would have made out one for Monsieur Rigaud), with ready confidence; and, when he kissed her hand, had herself passed it caressingly over his face.</s> <s sid="105" id="ld.c1.s105">Monsieur Rigaud, indifferent to this distinction, propitiated the father by laughing and nodding at the daughter as often as she gave him anything; and, so soon as he had all his viands about him in convenient nooks of the ledge on which he rested, began to eat with an appetite.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c3.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c3.s1">It was a Sunday evening in London, gloomy, close, and stale.</s> <s sid="2" id="ld.c3.s2">Maddening church bells of all degrees of dissonance, sharp and flat, cracked and clear, fast and slow, made the brick-and-mortar echoes hideous.</s> <s sid="3" id="ld.c3.s3">Melancholy streets, in a penitential garb of soot, steeped the souls of the people who were condemned to look at them out of windows, in dire despondency.</s> <s sid="4" id="ld.c3.s4">In every thoroughfare, up almost every alley, and down almost every turning, some doleful bell was throbbing, jerking, tolling, as if the Plague were in the city and the dead-carts were going round.</s> <s sid="5" id="ld.c3.s5">Everything was bolted and barred that could by possibility furnish relief to an overworked people.</s> <s sid="6" id="ld.c3.s6">No pictures, no unfamiliar animals, no rare plants or flowers, no natural or artificial wonders of the ancient world--all TABOO with that enlightened strictness, that the ugly South Sea gods in the British Museum might have supposed themselves at home again.</s> <s sid="7" id="ld.c3.s7">Nothing to see but streets, streets, streets.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c3.s8">Nothing to breathe but streets, streets, streets.</s> <s sid="9" id="ld.c3.s9">Nothing to change the brooding mind, or raise it up.</s> <s sid="10" id="ld.c3.s10">Nothing for the spent toiler to do, but to compare the monotony of his seventh day with the monotony of his six days, think what a weary life he led, and make the best of it--or the worst, according to the probabilities.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c3.p2"><s sid="11" id="ld.c3.s11">At such a happy time, so propitious to the interests of religion and morality, Mr Arthur Clennam, newly arrived from Marseilles by way of Dover, and by Dover coach the Blue-eyed Maid, sat in the window of a coffee-house on Ludgate Hill.</s> <s sid="12" id="ld.c3.s12">Ten thousand responsible houses surrounded him, frowning as heavily on the streets they composed, as if they were every one inhabited by the ten young men of the Calender's story, who blackened their faces and bemoaned their miseries every night.</s> <s sid="13" id="ld.c3.s13">Fifty thousand lairs surrounded him where people lived so unwholesomely that fair water put into their crowded rooms on Saturday night, would be corrupt on Sunday morning; albeit my lord, their county member, was amazed that they failed to sleep in company with their butcher's meat.</s> <s sid="14" id="ld.c3.s14">Miles of close wells and pits of houses, where the inhabitants gasped for air, stretched far away towards every point of the compass.</s> <s sid="15" id="ld.c3.s15">Through the heart of the town a deadly sewer ebbed and flowed, in the place of a fine fresh river.</s> <s sid="16" id="ld.c3.s16">What secular want could the million or so of human beings whose daily labour, six days in the week, lay among these Arcadian objects, from the sweet sameness of which they had no escape between the cradle and the grave--what secular want could they possibly have upon their seventh day?</s> <s sid="17" id="ld.c3.s17">Clearly they could want nothing but a stringent policeman.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ld.c3.p3"><s sid="18" id="ld.c3.s18">Mr Arthur Clennam sat in the window of the coffee-house on Ludgate Hill, counting one of the neighbouring bells, making sentences and burdens of songs out of it in spite of himself, and wondering how many sick people it might be the death of in the course of the year.</s> <s sid="19" id="ld.c3.s19">As the hour approached, its changes of measure made it more and more exasperating.</s> <s sid="20" id="ld.c3.s20">At the quarter, it went off into a condition of deadly-lively importunity, urging the populace in a voluble manner to Come to church, Come to church, Come to church!</s> <s sid="21" id="ld.c3.s21">At the ten minutes, it became aware that the congregation would be scanty, and slowly hammered out in low spirits, They WON'T come, they WON'T come, they WON'T come!</s> <s sid="22" id="ld.c3.s22">At the five minutes, it abandoned hope, and shook every house in the neighbourhood for three hundred seconds, with one dismal swing per second, as a groan of despair.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="ld.c3.p4" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="ld.c3.s23"><qs/>'Thank Heaven!'<qe/> said Clennam, when the hour struck, and the bell stopped.</s> </p><p pid="5" id="ld.c3.p5" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="ld.c3.s24">But its sound had revived a long train of miserable Sundays, and the procession would not stop with the bell, but continued to march on.</s> <s sid="25" id="ld.c3.s25"><qs/>'Heaven forgive me,'<qe/><sss/> said he, <sse/><qs/>'and those who trained me.</s> <s sid="26" id="ld.c3.s26">How I have hated this day!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="ld.c3.p6" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="ld.c3.s27">There was the dreary Sunday of his childhood, when he sat with his hands before him, scared out of his senses by a horrible tract which commenced business with the poor child by asking him in its title, why he was going to Perdition?--a piece of curiosity that he really, in a frock and drawers, was not in a condition to satisfy-- and which, for the further attraction of his infant mind, had a parenthesis in every other line with some such hiccupping reference as 2 Ep.</s> <s sid="28" id="ld.c3.s28">Thess. c. iii, v. 6 &amp; 7.</s> <s sid="29" id="ld.c3.s29">There was the sleepy Sunday of his boyhood, when, like a military deserter, he was marched to chapel by a picquet of teachers three times a day, morally handcuffed to another boy; and when he would willingly have bartered two meals of indigestible sermon for another ounce or two of inferior mutton at his scanty dinner in the flesh.</s> <s sid="30" id="ld.c3.s30">There was the interminable Sunday of his nonage; when his mother, stern of face and unrelenting of heart, would sit all day behind a Bible-- bound, like her own construction of it, in the hardest, barest, and straitest boards, with one dinted ornament on the cover like the drag of a chain, and a wrathful sprinkling of red upon the edges of the leaves--as if it, of all books!  were a fortification against sweetness of temper, natural affection, and gentle intercourse.</s> <s sid="31" id="ld.c3.s31">There was the resentful Sunday of a little later, when he sat down glowering and glooming through the tardy length of the day, with a sullen sense of injury in his heart, and no more real knowledge of the beneficent history of the New Testament than if he had been bred among idolaters.</s> <s sid="32" id="ld.c3.s32">There was a legion of Sundays, all days of unserviceable bitterness and mortification, slowly passing before him.</s> <s sid="33" id="ld.c3.s33"><qs/>'Beg pardon, sir,'<qe/> said a brisk waiter, rubbing the table.</s> <s sid="34" id="ld.c3.s34"><qs/>'Wish see bed-room?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="7" id="ld.c3.p7" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="ld.c3.s35"><qs/>'Yes.</s> <s sid="36" id="ld.c3.s36">I have just made up my mind to do it.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="8" id="ld.c3.p8" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="ld.c3.s37"><qs/>'Chaymaid!'<qe/> cried the waiter.</s> <s sid="38" id="ld.c3.s38"><qs/>'Gelen box num seven wish see room!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="9" id="ld.c3.p9" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="ld.c3.s39"><qs/>'Stay!'<qe/> said Clennam, rousing himself.</s> <s sid="40" id="ld.c3.s40"><qs/>'I was not thinking of what I said; I answered mechanically.</s> <s sid="41" id="ld.c3.s41">I am not going to sleep here.</s> <s sid="42" id="ld.c3.s42">I am going home.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="10" id="ld.c3.p10" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="ld.c3.s43"><qs/>'Deed, sir?</s> <s sid="44" id="ld.c3.s44">Chaymaid!</s> <s sid="45" id="ld.c3.s45">Gelen box num seven, not go sleep here, gome.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="ld.c3.p11"><s sid="46" id="ld.c3.s46">He sat in the same place as the day died, looking at the dull houses opposite, and thinking, if the disembodied spirits of former inhabitants were ever conscious of them, how they must pity themselves for their old places of imprisonment.</s> <s sid="47" id="ld.c3.s47">Sometimes a face would appear behind the dingy glass of a window, and would fade away into the gloom as if it had seen enough of life and had vanished out of it.</s> <s sid="48" id="ld.c3.s48">Presently the rain began to fall in slanting lines between him and those houses, and people began to collect under cover of the public passage opposite, and to look out hopelessly at the sky as the rain dropped thicker and faster.</s> <s sid="49" id="ld.c3.s49">Then wet umbrellas began to appear, draggled skirts, and mud.</s> <s sid="50" id="ld.c3.s50">What the mud had been doing with itself, or where it came from, who could say?</s> <s sid="51" id="ld.c3.s51">But it seemed to collect in a moment, as a crowd will, and in five minutes to have splashed all the sons and daughters of Adam.</s> <s sid="52" id="ld.c3.s52">The lamplighter was going his rounds now; and as the fiery jets sprang up under his touch, one might have fancied them astonished at being suffered to introduce any show of brightness into such a dismal scene.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="ld.c3.p12"><s sid="53" id="ld.c3.s53">Mr Arthur Clennam took up his hat and buttoned his coat, and walked out.</s> <s sid="54" id="ld.c3.s54">In the country, the rain would have developed a thousand fresh scents, and every drop would have had its bright association with some beautiful form of growth or life.</s> <s sid="55" id="ld.c3.s55">In the city, it developed only foul stale smells, and was a sickly, lukewarm, dirt- stained, wretched addition to the gutters.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="ld.c3.p13"><s sid="56" id="ld.c3.s56">He crossed by St Paul's and went down, at a long angle, almost to the water's edge, through some of the crooked and descending streets which lie (and lay more crookedly and closely then) between the river and Cheapside.</s> <s sid="57" id="ld.c3.s57">Passing, now the mouldy hall of some obsolete Worshipful Company, now the illuminated windows of a Congregationless Church that seemed to be waiting for some adventurous Belzoni to dig it out and discover its history; passing silent warehouses and wharves, and here and there a narrow alley leading to the river, where a wretched little bill, FOUND DROWNED, was weeping on the wet wall; he came at last to the house he sought.</s> <s sid="58" id="ld.c3.s58">An old brick house, so dingy as to be all but black, standing by itself within a gateway.</s> <s sid="59" id="ld.c3.s59">Before it, a square court-yard where a shrub or two and a patch of grass were as rank (which is saying much) as the iron railings enclosing them were rusty; behind it, a jumble of roots.</s> <s sid="60" id="ld.c3.s60">It was a double house, with long, narrow, heavily-framed windows.</s> <s sid="61" id="ld.c3.s61">Many years ago, it had had it in its mind to slide down sideways; it had been propped up, however, and was leaning on some half-dozen gigantic crutches: which gymnasium for the neighbouring cats, weather-stained, smoke- blackened, and overgrown with weeds, appeared in these latter days to be no very sure reliance.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="ld.c3.p16" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="ld.c3.s68">He had a candle in his hand, and he held it up for a moment to assist his keen eyes.</s> <s sid="69" id="ld.c3.s69"><qs/>'Ah, Mr Arthur?'<qe/><sls/> he said, without any emotion, <sle/><qs/>'you are come at last?</s> <s sid="70" id="ld.c3.s70">Step in.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="17" id="ld.c3.p17"><s sid="71" id="ld.c3.s71">Mr Arthur stepped in and shut the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c4.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c4.s1">When Mrs Flintwinch dreamed, she usually dreamed, unlike the son of her old mistress, with her eyes shut.</s> <s sid="2" id="ld.c4.s2">She had a curiously vivid dream that night, and before she had left the son of her old mistress many hours.</s> <s sid="3" id="ld.c4.s3">In fact it was not at all like a dream; it was so very real in every respect.</s> <s sid="4" id="ld.c4.s4">It happened in this wise.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c4.p2"><s sid="5" id="ld.c4.s5">The bed-chamber occupied by Mr and Mrs Flintwinch was within a few paces of that to which Mrs Clennam had been so long confined.</s> <s sid="6" id="ld.c4.s6">It was not on the same floor, for it was a room at the side of the house, which was approached by a steep descent of a few odd steps, diverging from the main staircase nearly opposite to Mrs Clennam's door.</s> <s sid="7" id="ld.c4.s7">It could scarcely be said to be within call, the walls, doors, and panelling of the old place were so cumbrous; but it was within easy reach, in any undress, at any hour of the night, in any temperature.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c4.s8">At the head of the bed and within a foot of Mrs Flintwinch's ear, was a bell, the line of which hung ready to Mrs Clennam's hand.</s> <s sid="9" id="ld.c4.s9">Whenever this bell rang, up started Affery, and was in the sick room before she was awake.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ld.c4.p3"><s sid="10" id="ld.c4.s10">Having got her mistress into bed, lighted her lamp, and given her good night, Mrs Flintwinch went to roost as usual, saving that her lord had not yet appeared.</s> <s sid="11" id="ld.c4.s11">It was her lord himself who became-- unlike the last theme in the mind, according to the observation of most philosophers--the subject of Mrs Flintwinch's dream.</s> <s sid="12" id="ld.c4.s12">It seemed to her that she awoke after sleeping some hours, and found Jeremiah not yet abed.</s> <s sid="13" id="ld.c4.s13">That she looked at the candle she had left burning, and, measuring the time like King Alfred the Great, was confirmed by its wasted state in her belief that she had been asleep for some considerable period.</s> <s sid="14" id="ld.c4.s14">That she arose thereupon, muffled herself up in a wrapper, put on her shoes, and went out on the staircase, much surprised, to look for Jeremiah.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="ld.c4.p4"><s sid="15" id="ld.c4.s15">The staircase was as wooden and solid as need be, and Affery went straight down it without any of those deviations peculiar to dreams.</s> <s sid="16" id="ld.c4.s16">She did not skim over it, but walked down it, and guided herself by the banisters on account of her candle having died out.</s> <s sid="17" id="ld.c4.s17">In one corner of the hall, behind the house-door, there was a little waiting-room, like a well-shaft, with a long narrow window in it as if it had been ripped up.</s> <s sid="18" id="ld.c4.s18">In this room, which was never used, a light was burning.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="ld.c4.p5"><s sid="19" id="ld.c4.s19">Mrs Flintwinch crossed the hall, feeling its pavement cold to her stockingless feet, and peeped in between the rusty hinges on the door, which stood a little open.</s> <s sid="20" id="ld.c4.s20">She expected to see Jeremiah fast asleep or in a fit, but he was calmly seated in a chair, awake, and in his usual health.</s> <s sid="21" id="ld.c4.s21">But what--hey?--Lord forgive us!--Mrs Flintwinch muttered some ejaculation to this effect, and turned giddy.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="ld.c4.p6"><s sid="22" id="ld.c4.s22">For, Mr Flintwinch awake, was watching Mr Flintwinch asleep.</s> <s sid="23" id="ld.c4.s23">He sat on one side of the small table, looking keenly at himself on the other side with his chin sunk on his breast, snoring.</s> <s sid="24" id="ld.c4.s24">The waking Flintwinch had his full front face presented to his wife; the sleeping Flintwinch was in profile.</s> <s sid="25" id="ld.c4.s25">The waking Flintwinch was the old original; the sleeping Flintwinch was the double.  just as she might have distinguished between a tangible object and its reflection in a glass, Affery made out this difference with her head going round and round.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c6.p2"><s sid="3" id="ld.c6.s3">It was an oblong pile of barrack building, partitioned into squalid houses standing back to back, so that there were no back rooms; environed by a narrow paved yard, hemmed in by high walls duly spiked at top.</s> <s sid="4" id="ld.c6.s4">Itself a close and confined prison for debtors, it contained within it a much closer and more confined jail for smugglers.</s> <s sid="5" id="ld.c6.s5">Offenders against the revenue laws, and defaulters to excise or customs who had incurred fines which they were unable to pay, were supposed to be incarcerated behind an iron-plated door closing up a second prison, consisting of a strong cell or two, and a blind alley some yard and a half wide, which formed the mysterious termination of the very limited skittle-ground in which the Marshalsea debtors bowled down their troubles.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 12 Bleeding Heart Yard</title>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c12.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c12.s1">In London itself, though in the old rustic road towards a suburb of note where in the days of William Shakespeare, author and stage- player, there were Royal hunting-seats--howbeit no sport is left there now but for hunters of men--Bleeding Heart Yard was to be found; a place much changed in feature and in fortune, yet with some relish of ancient greatness about it.</s> <s sid="2" id="ld.c12.s2">Two or three mighty stacks of chimneys, and a few large dark rooms which had escaped being walled and subdivided out of the recognition of their old proportions, gave the Yard a character.</s> <s sid="3" id="ld.c12.s3">It was inhabited by poor people, who set up their rest among its faded glories, as Arabs of the desert pitch their tents among the fallen stones of the Pyramids; but there was a family sentimental feeling prevalent in the Yard, that it had a character.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c12.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="ld.c12.s4">As if the aspiring city had become puffed up in the very ground on which it stood, the ground had so risen about Bleeding Heart Yard that you got into it down a flight of steps which formed no part of the original approach, and got out of it by a low gateway into a maze of shabby streets, which went about and about, tortuously ascending to the level again.</s> <s sid="5" id="ld.c12.s5">At this end of the Yard and over the gateway, was the factory of Daniel Doyce, often heavily beating like a bleeding heart of iron, with the clink of metal upon metal.</s> <s sid="6" id="ld.c12.s6">The opinion of the Yard was divided respecting the derivation of its name.</s> <s sid="7" id="ld.c12.s7">The more practical of its inmates abided by the tradition of a murder; the gentler and more imaginative inhabitants, including the whole of the tender sex, were loyal to the legend of a young lady of former times closely imprisoned in her chamber by a cruel father for remaining true to her own true love, and refusing to marry the suitor he chose for her.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c12.s8">The legend related how that the young lady used to be seen up at her window behind the bars, murmuring a love-lorn song of which the burden was, <qs/>'Bleeding Heart, Bleeding Heart, bleeding away,'<qe/> until she died.</s> <s sid="9" id="ld.c12.s9">It was objected by the murderous party that this Refrain was notoriously the invention of a tambour-worker, a spinster and romantic, still lodging in the Yard.</s> <s sid="10" id="ld.c12.s10">But, forasmuch as all favourite legends must be associated with the affections, and as many more people fall in love than commit murder--which it may be hoped, howsoever bad we are, will continue until the end of the world to be the dispensation under which we shall live--the Bleeding Heart, Bleeding Heart, bleeding away story, carried the day by a great majority.</s> <s sid="11" id="ld.c12.s11">Neither party would listen to the antiquaries who delivered learned lectures in the neighbourhood, showing the Bleeding Heart to have been the heraldic cognisance of the old family to whom the property had once belonged.</s> <s sid="12" id="ld.c12.s12">And, considering that the hour-glass they turned from year to year was filled with the earthiest and coarsest sand, the Bleeding Heart Yarders had reason enough for objecting to be despoiled of the one little golden grain of poetry that sparkled in it.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="ld.c12.p3"><s sid="13" id="ld.c12.s13">Down in to the Yard, by way of the steps, came Daniel Doyce, Mr Meagles, and Clennam.</s> <s sid="14" id="ld.c12.s14">Passing along the Yard, and between the open doors on either hand, all abundantly garnished with light children nursing heavy ones, they arrived at its opposite boundary, the gateway.</s> <s sid="15" id="ld.c12.s15">Here Arthur Clennam stopped to look about him for the domicile of Plornish, plasterer, whose name, according to the custom of Londoners, Daniel Doyce had never seen or heard of to that hour.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="ld.c12.p4"><s sid="16" id="ld.c12.s16">It was plain enough, nevertheless, as Little Dorrit had said; over a lime-splashed gateway in the corner, within which Plornish kept a ladder and a barrel or two.</s> <s sid="17" id="ld.c12.s17">The last house in Bleeding Heart Yard which she had described as his place of habitation, was a large house, let off to various tenants; but Plornish ingeniously hinted that he lived in the parlour, by means of a painted hand under his name, the forefinger of which hand (on which the artist had depicted a ring and a most elaborate nail of the genteelest form) referred all inquirers to that apartment.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="ld.c12.p5"><s sid="18" id="ld.c12.s18">Parting from his companions, after arranging another meeting with Mr Meagles, Clennam went alone into the entry, and knocked with his knuckles at the parlour-door.</s> <s sid="19" id="ld.c12.s19">It was opened presently by a woman with a child in her arms, whose unoccupied hand was hastily rearranging the upper part of her dress.</s> <s sid="20" id="ld.c12.s20">This was Mrs Plornish, and this maternal action was the action of Mrs Plornish during a large part of her waking existence.</s> </p>

been made to swallow for the improvement of his form), was to be parted with for a twenty-pound note, in consequence of his having run away last week with Mrs Captain Barbary of Cheltenham, who wasn't up to a horse of his courage, and who, in mere spite, insisted on selling him for that ridiculous sum: or, in other words, on giving him away.</s> <s sid="119" id="ld.c12.s119">Plornish, going up this

would augur from appearances that he meant business, and might be induced to talk to him.</s> <s sid="121" id="ld.c12.s121">On this hint, Mr Plornish retired to communicate with his Principal, and

<p pid="33" id="ld.c25.p33"><s sid="107" id="ld.c25.s107">The foreigner, by name John Baptist Cavalletto--they called him Mr Baptist in the Yard--was such a chirping, easy, hopeful little fellow, that his attraction for Pancks was probably in the force of contrast.</s> <s sid="108" id="ld.c25.s108">Solitary, weak, and scantily acquainted with the most necessary words of the only language in which he could communicate with the people about him, he went with the stream of his fortunes, in a brisk way that was new in those parts.</s> <s sid="109" id="ld.c25.s109">With little to eat, and less to drink, and nothing to wear but what he wore upon him, or had brought tied up in one of the smallest bundles that ever were seen, he put as bright a face upon it as if he were in the most flourishing circumstances when he first hobbled up and down the Yard, humbly propitiating the general good-will with his white teeth.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="ld.c25.p34"><s sid="110" id="ld.c25.s110">It was uphill work for a foreigner, lame or sound, to make his way with the Bleeding Hearts.</s> <s sid="111" id="ld.c25.s111">In the first place, they were vaguely persuaded that every foreigner had a knife about him; in the second, they held it to be a sound constitutional national axiom that he ought to go home to his own country.</s> <s sid="112" id="ld.c25.s112">They never thought of inquiring how many of their own countrymen would be returned upon their hands from divers parts of the world, if the principle were generally recognised; they considered it particularly and peculiarly British.</s> <s sid="113" id="ld.c25.s113">In the third place, they had a notion that it was a sort of Divine visitation upon a foreigner that he was not an Englishman, and that all kinds of calamities happened to his country because it did things that England did not, and did not do things that England did.</s> <s sid="114" id="ld.c25.s114">In this belief, to be sure, they had long been carefully trained by the Barnacles and Stiltstalkings, who were always proclaiming to them, officially, that no country which failed to submit itself to those two large families could possibly hope to be under the protection of Providence; and who, when they believed it, disparaged them in private as the most prejudiced people under the sun.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="ld.c25.p35"><s sid="115" id="ld.c25.s115">This, therefore, might be called a political position of the Bleeding Hearts; but they entertained other objections to having foreigners in the Yard.</s> <s sid="116" id="ld.c25.s116">They believed that foreigners were always badly off; and though they were as ill off themselves as they could desire to be, that did not diminish the force of the objection.</s> <s sid="117" id="ld.c25.s117">They believed that foreigners were dragooned and bayoneted; and though they certainly got their own skulls promptly fractured if they showed any ill-humour, still it was with a blunt instrument, and that didn't count.</s> <s sid="118" id="ld.c25.s118">They believed that foreigners were always immoral; and though they had an occasional assize at home, and now and then a divorce case or so, that had nothing to do with it.</s> <s sid="119" id="ld.c25.s119">They believed that foreigners had no independent spirit, as never being escorted to the poll in droves by Lord Decimus Tite Barnacle, with colours flying and the tune of Rule Britannia playing.</s> <s sid="120" id="ld.c25.s120">Not to be tedious, they had many other beliefs of a similar kind.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c26.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c26.s1">If Arthur Clennam had not arrived at that wise decision firmly to restrain himself from loving Pet, he would have lived on in a state of much perplexity, involving difficult struggles with his own heart.</s> <s sid="2" id="ld.c26.s2">Not the least of these would have been a contention, always waging within it, between a tendency to dislike Mr Henry Gowan, if not to regard him with positive repugnance, and a whisper that the inclination was unworthy.</s> <s sid="3" id="ld.c26.s3">A generous nature is not prone to strong aversions, and is slow to admit them even dispassionately; but when it finds ill-will gaining upon it, and can discern between-whiles that its origin is not dispassionate, such a nature becomes distressed.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c26.p2"><s sid="4" id="ld.c26.s4">Therefore Mr Henry Gowan would have clouded Clennam's mind, and would have been far oftener present to it than more agreeable persons and subjects but for the great prudence of his decision aforesaid.</s> <s sid="5" id="ld.c26.s5">As it was, Mr Gowan seemed transferred to Daniel Doyce's mind; at all events, it so happened that it usually fell to Mr Doyce's turn, rather than to Clennam's, to speak of him in the friendly conversations they held together.</s> <s sid="6" id="ld.c26.s6">These were of frequent occurrence now; as the two partners shared a portion of a roomy house in one of the grave old-fashioned City streets, lying not far from the Bank of England, by London Wall.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c28.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c28.s1">Not resting satisfied with the endeavours he had made to recover his lost charge, Mr Meagles addressed a letter of remonstrance, breathing nothing but goodwill, not only to her, but to Miss Wade too.</s> <s sid="2" id="ld.c28.s2">No answer coming to these epistles, or to another written to the stubborn girl by the hand of her late young mistress, which might have melted her if anything could (all three letters were returned weeks afterwards as having been refused at the house- door), he deputed Mrs Meagles to make the experiment of a personal interview.</s> <s sid="3" id="ld.c28.s3">That worthy lady being unable to obtain one, and being steadfastly denied admission, Mr Meagles besought Arthur to essay once more what he could do.</s> <s sid="4" id="ld.c28.s4">All that came of his compliance was, his discovery that the empty house was left in charge of the old woman, that Miss Wade was gone, that the waifs and strays of furniture were gone, and that the old woman would accept any number of half-crowns and thank the donor kindly, but had no information whatever to exchange for those coins, beyond constantly offering for perusal a memorandum relative to fixtures, which the house- agent's young man had left in the hall.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c28.p2"><s sid="5" id="ld.c28.s5">Unwilling, even under this discomfiture, to resign the ingrate and leave her hopeless, in case of her better dispositions obtaining the mastery over the darker side of her character, Mr Meagles, for six successive days, published a discreetly covert advertisement in the morning papers, to the effect that if a certain young person who had lately left home without reflection, would at any time apply to his address at Twickenham, everything would be as it had been before, and no reproaches need be apprehended.</s> <s sid="6" id="ld.c28.s6">The unexpected consequences of this notification suggested to the dismayed Mr Meagles for the first time that some hundreds of young persons must be leaving their homes without reflection every day; for shoals of wrong young people came down to Twickenham, who, not finding themselves received with enthusiasm, generally demanded compensation by way of damages, in addition to coach-hire there and back.</s> <s sid="7" id="ld.c28.s7">Nor were these the only uninvited clients whom the advertisement produced.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c28.s8">The swarm of begging-letter writers, who would seem to be always watching eagerly for any hook, however small, to hang a letter upon, wrote to say that having seen the advertisement, they were induced to apply with confidence for various sums, ranging from ten shillings to fifty pounds: not because they knew anything about the young person, but because they felt that to part with those donations would greatly relieve the advertiser's mind.</s> <s sid="9" id="ld.c28.s9">Several projectors, likewise, availed themselves of the same opportunity to correspond with Mr Meagles; as, for example, to apprise him that their attention having been called to the advertisement by a friend, they begged to state that if they should ever hear anything of the young person, they would not fail to make it known to him immediately, and that in the meantime if he would oblige them with the funds necessary for bringing to perfection a certain entirely novel description of Pump, the happiest results would ensue to mankind.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ld.c28.p3"><s sid="10" id="ld.c28.s10">Mr Meagles and his family, under these combined discouragements, had begun reluctantly to give up Tattycoram as irrecoverable, when the new and active firm of Doyce and Clennam, in their private capacities, went down on a Saturday to stay at the cottage until Monday.</s> <s sid="11" id="ld.c28.s11">The senior partner took the coach, and the junior partner took his walking-stick.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 29 Mrs Flintwinch goes on Dreaming</title>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c29.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c29.s1">The house in the city preserved its heavy dulness through all these transactions, and the invalid within it turned the same unvarying round of life.</s> <s sid="2" id="ld.c29.s2">Morning, noon, and night, morning, noon, and night, each recurring with its accompanying monotony, always the same reluctant return of the same sequences of machinery, like a dragging piece of clockwork.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c29.p2"><s sid="3" id="ld.c29.s3">The wheeled chair had its associated remembrances and reveries, one may suppose, as every place that is made the station of a human being has.</s> <s sid="4" id="ld.c29.s4">Pictures of demolished streets and altered houses, as they formerly were when the occupant of the chair was familiar with them, images of people as they too used to be, with little or no allowance made for the lapse of time since they were seen; of these, there must have been many in the long routine of gloomy days.</s> <s sid="5" id="ld.c29.s5">To stop the clock of busy existence at the hour when we were personally sequestered from it, to suppose mankind stricken motionless when we were brought to a stand-still, to be unable to measure the changes beyond our view by any larger standard than the shrunken one of our own uniform and contracted existence, is the infirmity of many invalids, and the mental unhealthiness of almost all recluses.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ld.c29.p3"><s sid="6" id="ld.c29.s6">What scenes and actors the stern woman most reviewed, as she sat from season to season in her one dark room, none knew but herself.</s> <s sid="7" id="ld.c29.s7">Mr Flintwinch, with his wry presence brought to bear upon her daily like some eccentric mechanical force, would perhaps have screwed it out of her, if there had been less resistance in her; but she was too strong for him.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c29.s8">So far as Mistress Affery was concerned, to regard her liege-lord and her disabled mistress with a face of blank wonder, to go about the house after dark with her apron over her head, always to listen for the strange noises and sometimes to hear them, and never to emerge from her ghostly, dreamy, sleep- waking state, was occupation enough for her.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="ld.c29.p4"><s sid="9" id="ld.c29.s9">There was a fair stroke of business doing, as Mistress Affery made out, for her husband had abundant occupation in his little office, and saw more people than had been used to come there for some years.</s> <s sid="10" id="ld.c29.s10">This might easily be, the house having been long deserted; but he did receive letters, and comers, and keep books, and correspond.</s> <s sid="11" id="ld.c29.s11">Moreover, he went about to other counting-houses, and to wharves, and docks, and to the Custom House,' and to Garraway's Coffee House, and the Jerusalem Coffee House, and on 'Change; so that he was much in and out.</s> <s sid="12" id="ld.c29.s12">He began, too, sometimes of an evening, when Mrs Clennam expressed no particular wish for his society, to resort to a tavern in the neighbourhood to look at the shipping news and closing prices in the evening paper, and even to exchange Small socialities with mercantile Sea Captains who frequented that establishment.</s> <s sid="13" id="ld.c29.s13">At some period of every day, he and Mrs Clennam held a council on matters of business; and it appeared to Affery, who was always groping about, listening and watching, that the two clever ones were making money.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="ld.c29.p5"><s sid="14" id="ld.c29.s14">The state of mind into which Mr Flintwinch's dazed lady had fallen, had now begun to be so expressed in all her looks and actions that she was held in very low account by the two clever ones, as a person, never of strong intellect, who was becoming foolish.</s> <s sid="15" id="ld.c29.s15">Perhaps because her appearance was not of a commercial cast, or perhaps because it occurred to him that his having taken her to wife might expose his judgment to doubt in the minds of customers, Mr Flintwinch laid his commands upon her that she should hold her peace on the subject of her conjugal relations, and should no longer call him Jeremiah out of the domestic trio.</s> <s sid="16" id="ld.c29.s16">Her frequent forgetfulness of this admonition intensified her startled manner, since Mr Flintwinch's habit of avenging himself on her remissness by making springs after her on the staircase, and shaking her, occasioned her to be always nervously uncertain when she might be thus waylaid next.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 33 Mrs Merdle's Complaint</title>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c33.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c33.s1">Resigning herself to inevitable fate by making the best of those people, the Miggleses, and submitting her philosophy to the draught upon it, of which she had foreseen the likelihood in her interview with Arthur, Mrs Gowan handsomely resolved not to oppose her son's marriage.</s> <s sid="2" id="ld.c33.s2">In her progress to, and happy arrival at, this resolution, she was possibly influenced, not only by her maternal affections but by three politic considerations.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c33.p2"><s sid="3" id="ld.c33.s3">Of these, the first may have been that her son had never signified the smallest intention to ask her consent, or any mistrust of his ability to dispense with it; the second, that the pension bestowed upon her by a grateful country (and a Barnacle) would be freed from any little filial inroads, when her Henry should be married to the darling only child of a man in very easy circumstances; the third, that Henry's debts must clearly be paid down upon the altar-railing by his father-in-law.</s> <s sid="4" id="ld.c33.s4">When, to these three-fold points of prudence there is added the fact that Mrs Gowan yielded her consent the moment she knew of Mr Meagles having yielded his, and that Mr Meagles's objection to the marriage had been the sole obstacle in its way all along, it becomes the height of probability that the relict of the deceased Commissioner of nothing particular, turned these ideas in her sagacious mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ld.c33.p3" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="ld.c33.s5">Among her connections and acquaintances, however, she maintained her individual dignity and the dignity of the blood of the Barnacles, by diligently nursing the pretence that it was a most unfortunate business; that she was sadly cut up by it; that this was a perfect fascination under which Henry laboured; that she had opposed it for a long time, but what could a mother do; and the like.</s> <s sid="6" id="ld.c33.s6">She had already called Arthur Clennam to bear witness to this fable, as a friend of the Meagles family; and she followed up the move by now impounding the family itself for the same purpose.</s> <s sid="7" id="ld.c33.s7">In the first interview she accorded to Mr Meagles, she slided herself into the position of disconsolately but gracefully yielding to irresistible pressure.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c33.s8">With the utmost politeness and good- breeding, she feigned that it was she--not he--who had made the difficulty, and who at length gave way; and that the sacrifice was hers--not his.</s> <s sid="9" id="ld.c33.s9">The same feint, with the same polite dexterity, she foisted on Mrs Meagles, as a conjuror might have forced a card on that innocent lady; and, when her future daughter-in-law was presented to her by her son, she said on embracing her, <qs/>'My dear, what have you done to Henry that has bewitched him so!'<qe/> at the same time allowing a few tears to carry before them, in little pills, the cosmetic powder on her nose; as a delicate but touching signal that she suffered much inwardly for the show of composure with which she bore her misfortune.</s> </p><p pid="4" id="ld.c33.p4"><s sid="10" id="ld.c33.s10">Among the friends of Mrs Gowan (who piqued herself at once on being Society, and on maintaining intimate and easy relations with that Power), Mrs Merdle occupied a front row.</s> <s sid="11" id="ld.c33.s11">True, the Hampton Court Bohemians, without exception, turned up their noses at Merdle as an upstart; but they turned them down again, by falling flat on their faces to worship his wealth.</s> <s sid="12" id="ld.c33.s12">In which compensating adjustment of their noses, they were pretty much like Treasury, Bar, and Bishop, and all the rest of them.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="ld.c33.p5"><s sid="13" id="ld.c33.s13">To Mrs Merdle, Mrs Gowan repaired on a visit of self-condolence, after having given the gracious consent aforesaid.</s> <s sid="14" id="ld.c33.s14">She drove into town for the purpose in a one-horse carriage irreverently called at that period of English history, a pill-box.</s> <s sid="15" id="ld.c33.s15">It belonged to a job- master in a small way, who drove it himself, and who jobbed it by the day, or hour, to most of the old ladies in Hampton Court Palace; but it was a point of ceremony, in that encampment, that the whole equipage should be tacitly regarded as the private property of the jobber for the time being, and that the job-master should betray personal knowledge of nobody but the jobber in possession.</s> <s sid="16" id="ld.c33.s16">So the Circumlocution Barnacles, who were the largest job-masters in the universe, always pretended to know of no other job but the job immediately in hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ld.c36.p3"><s sid="7" id="ld.c36.s7">Towards the Marshal, who was a Marshal of many years' standing, and with whom he had never had any previous difference, Mr Dorrit comported himself with severity.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c36.s8">That officer, on personally tendering his congratulations, offered the free use of two rooms in his house for Mr Dorrit's occupation until his departure.</s> <s sid="9" id="ld.c36.s9">Mr Dorrit thanked him at the moment, and replied that he would think of it; but the Marshal was no sooner gone than he sat down and wrote him a cutting note, in which he remarked that he had never on any former occasion had the honour of receiving his congratulations (which was true, though indeed there had not been anything particular to congratulate him upon), and that he begged, on behalf of himself and family, to repudiate the Marshal's offer, with all those thanks which its disinterested character and its perfect independence of all worldly considerations demanded.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 2 Mrs General</title>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c38.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c38.s1">It is indispensable to present the accomplished lady who was of sufficient importance in the suite of the Dorrit Family to have a line to herself in the Travellers' Book.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c38.p2"><s sid="2" id="ld.c38.s2">Mrs General was the daughter of a clerical dignitary in a cathedral town, where she had led the fashion until she was as near forty- five as a single lady can be.</s> <s sid="3" id="ld.c38.s3">A stiff commissariat officer of sixty, famous as a martinet, had then become enamoured of the gravity with which she drove the proprieties four-in-hand through the cathedral town society, and had solicited to be taken beside her on the box of the cool coach of ceremony to which that team was harnessed.</s> <s sid="4" id="ld.c38.s4">His proposal of marriage being accepted by the lady, the commissary took his seat behind the proprieties with great decorum, and Mrs General drove until the commissary died.</s> <s sid="5" id="ld.c38.s5">In the course of their united journey, they ran over several people who came in the way of the proprieties; but always in a high style and with composure.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ld.c38.p3"><s sid="6" id="ld.c38.s6">The commissary having been buried with all the decorations suitable to the service (the whole team of proprieties were harnessed to his hearse, and they all had feathers and black velvet housings with his coat of arms in the corner), Mrs General began to inquire what quantity of dust and ashes was deposited at the bankers'.</s> <s sid="7" id="ld.c38.s7">It then transpired that the commissary had so far stolen a march on Mrs General as to have bought himself an annuity some years before his marriage, and to have reserved that circumstance in mentioning, at the period of his proposal, that his income was derived from the interest of his money.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c38.s8">Mrs General consequently found her means so much diminished, that, but for the perfect regulation of her mind, she might have felt disposed to question the accuracy of that portion of the late service which had declared that the commissary could take nothing away with him.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="ld.c38.p4" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="ld.c38.s9">In this state of affairs it occurred to Mrs General, that she might <qs/>'form the mind,'<qe/> and eke the manners of some young lady of distinction.</s> <s sid="10" id="ld.c38.s10">Or, that she might harness the proprieties to the carriage of some rich young heiress or widow, and become at once the driver and guard of such vehicle through the social mazes.</s> <s sid="11" id="ld.c38.s11">Mrs General's communication of this idea to her clerical and commissariat connection was so warmly applauded that, but for the lady's undoubted merit, it might have appeared as though they wanted to get rid of her.</s> <s sid="12" id="ld.c38.s12">Testimonials representing Mrs General as a prodigy of piety, learning, virtue, and gentility, were lavishly contributed from influential quarters; and one venerable archdeacon even shed tears in recording his testimony to her perfections (described to him by persons on whom he could rely), though he had never had the honour and moral gratification of setting eyes on Mrs General in all his life.</s> </p><p pid="5" id="ld.c38.p5"><s sid="13" id="ld.c38.s13">Thus delegated on her mission, as it were by Church and State, Mrs General, who had always occupied high ground, felt in a condition to keep it, and began by putting herself up at a very high figure.</s> <s sid="14" id="ld.c38.s14">An interval of some duration elapsed, in which there was no bid for Mrs General.</s> <s sid="15" id="ld.c38.s15">At length a county-widower, with a daughter of fourteen, opened negotiations with the lady; and as it was a part either of the native dignity or of the artificial policy of Mrs General (but certainly one or the other) to comport herself as if she were much more sought than seeking, the widower pursued Mrs General until he prevailed upon her to form his daughter's mind and manners.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="ld.c38.p6"><s sid="16" id="ld.c38.s16">The execution of this trust occupied Mrs General about seven years, in the course of which time she made the tour of Europe, and saw most of that extensive miscellany of objects which it is essential that all persons of polite cultivation should see with other people's eyes, and never with their own.</s> <s sid="17" id="ld.c38.s17">When her charge was at length formed, the marriage, not only of the young lady, but likewise of her father, the widower, was resolved on.</s> <s sid="18" id="ld.c38.s18">The widower then finding Mrs General both inconvenient and expensive, became of a sudden almost as much affected by her merits as the archdeacon had been, and circulated such praises of her surpassing worth, in all quarters where he thought an opportunity might arise of transferring the blessing to somebody else, that Mrs General was a name more honourable than ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="ld.c39.p74"><s sid="262" id="ld.c39.s262">Among the day's unrealities would be roads where the bright red vines were looped and garlanded together on trees for many miles; woods of olives; white villages and towns on hill-sides, lovely without, but frightful in their dirt and poverty within; crosses by the way; deep blue lakes with fairy islands, and clustering boats with awnings of bright colours and sails of beautiful forms; vast piles of building mouldering to dust; hanging-gardens where the weeds had grown so strong that their stems, like wedges driven home, had split the arch and rent the wall; stone-terraced lanes, with the lizards running into and out of every chink; beggars of all sorts everywhere: pitiful, picturesque, hungry, merry; children beggars and aged beggars.</s> <s sid="263" id="ld.c39.s263">Often at posting-houses and other halting places, these miserable creatures would appear to her the only realities of the day; and many a time, when the money she had brought to give them was all given away, she would sit with her folded hands, thoughtfully looking after some diminutive girl leading her grey father, as if the sight reminded her of something in the days that were gone.</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="ld.c39.p75"><s sid="264" id="ld.c39.s264">Again, there would be places where they stayed the week together in splendid rooms, had banquets every day, rode out among heaps of wonders, walked through miles of palaces, and rested in dark corners of great churches; where there were winking lamps of gold and silver among pillars and arches, kneeling figures dotted about at confessionals and on the pavements; where there was the mist and scent of incense; where there were pictures, fantastic images, gaudy altars, great heights and distances, all softly lighted through stained glass, and the massive curtains that hung in the doorways.</s> <s sid="265" id="ld.c39.s265">From these cities they would go on again, by the roads of vines and olives, through squalid villages, where there was not a hovel without a gap in its filthy walls, not a window with a whole inch of glass or paper; where there seemed to be nothing to support life, nothing to eat, nothing to make, nothing to grow, nothing to hope, nothing to do but die.</s> </p>

<p pid="76" id="ld.c39.p76"><s sid="266" id="ld.c39.s266">Again they would come to whole towns of palaces, whose proper inmates were all banished, and which were all changed into barracks: troops of idle soldiers leaning out of the state windows, where their accoutrements hung drying on the marble architecture, and showing to the mind like hosts of rats who were (happily) eating away the props of the edifices that supported them, and must soon, with them, be smashed on the heads of the other swarms of soldiers and the swarms of priests, and the swarms of spies, who were all the ill-looking population left to be ruined, in the streets below.</s> </p>

<p pid="78" id="ld.c39.p78"><s sid="269" id="ld.c39.s269">In this crowning unreality, where all the streets were paved with water, and where the deathlike stillness of the days and nights was broken by no sound but the softened ringing of church-bells, the rippling of the current, and the cry of the gondoliers turning the corners of the flowing streets, Little Dorrit, quite lost by her task being done, sat down to muse.</s> <s sid="270" id="ld.c39.s270">The family began a gay life, went here and there, and turned night into day; but she was timid of joining in their gaieties, and only asked leave to be left alone.</s> </p>

<p pid="80" id="ld.c39.p80"><s sid="274" id="ld.c39.s274">But her favourite station was the balcony of her own room, overhanging the canal, with other balconies below, and none above.</s> <s sid="275" id="ld.c39.s275">It was of massive stone darkened by ages, built in a wild fancy which came from the East to that collection of wild fancies; and Little Dorrit was little indeed, leaning on the broad-cushioned ledge, and looking over.</s> <s sid="276" id="ld.c39.s276">As she liked no place of an evening half so well, she soon began to be watched for, and many eyes in passing gondolas were raised, and many people said, There was the little figure of the English girl who was always alone.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 5 Something Wrong Somewhere</title>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c41.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c41.s1">The family had been a month or two at Venice, when Mr Dorrit, who was much among Counts and Marquises, and had but scant leisure, set an hour of one day apart, beforehand, for the purpose of holding some conference with Mrs General.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c41.p2"><s sid="2" id="ld.c41.s2">The time he had reserved in his mind arriving, he sent Mr Tinkler, his valet, to Mrs General's apartment (which would have absorbed about a third of the area of the Marshalsea), to present his compliments to that lady, and represent him as desiring the favour of an interview.</s> <s sid="3" id="ld.c41.s3">It being that period of the forenoon when the various members of the family had coffee in their own chambers, some couple of hours before assembling at breakfast in a faded hall which had once been sumptuous, but was now the prey of watery vapours and a settled melancholy, Mrs General was accessible to the valet.</s> <s sid="4" id="ld.c41.s4">That envoy found her on a little square of carpet, so extremely diminutive in reference to the size of her stone and marble floor that she looked as if she might have had it spread for the trying on of a ready-made pair of shoes; or as if she had come into possession of the enchanted piece of carpet, bought for forty purses by one of the three princes in the Arabian Nights, and had that moment been transported on it, at a wish, into a palatial saloon with which it had no connection.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c42.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c42.s1">To be in the halting state of Mr Henry Gowan; to have left one of two powers in disgust; to want the necessary qualifications for finding promotion with another, and to be loitering moodily about on neutral ground, cursing both; is to be in a situation unwholesome for the mind, which time is not likely to improve.</s> <s sid="2" id="ld.c42.s2">The worst class of sum worked in the every-day world is cyphered by the diseased arithmeticians who are always in the rule of Subtraction as to the merits and successes of others, and never in Addition as to their own.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c42.p2"><s sid="3" id="ld.c42.s3">The habit, too, of seeking some sort of recompense in the discontented boast of being disappointed, is a habit fraught with degeneracy.</s> <s sid="4" id="ld.c42.s4">A certain idle carelessness and recklessness of consistency soon comes of it.</s> <s sid="5" id="ld.c42.s5">To bring deserving things down by setting undeserving things up is one of its perverted delights; and there is no playing fast and loose with the truth, in any game, without growing the worse for it.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ld.c42.p3" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="ld.c42.s6">In his expressed opinions of all performances in the Art of painting that were completely destitute of merit, Gowan was the most liberal fellow on earth.</s> <s sid="7" id="ld.c42.s7">He would declare such a man to have more power in his little finger (provided he had none), than such another had (provided he had much) in his whole mind and body.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c42.s8">If the objection were taken that the thing commended was trash, he would reply, on behalf of his art, <qs/>'My good fellow, what do we all turn out but trash?</s> <s sid="9" id="ld.c42.s9">I turn out nothing else, and I make you a present of the confession.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="4" id="ld.c42.p4"><s sid="10" id="ld.c42.s10">To make a vaunt of being poor was another of the incidents of his splenetic state, though this may have had the design in it of showing that he ought to be rich; just as he would publicly laud and decry the Barnacles, lest it should be forgotten that he belonged to the family.</s> <s sid="11" id="ld.c42.s11">Howbeit, these two subjects were very often on his lips; and he managed them so well that he might have praised himself by the month together, and not have made himself out half so important a man as he did by his light disparagement of his claims on anybody's consideration.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="ld.c42.p5"><s sid="12" id="ld.c42.s12">Out of this same airy talk of his, it always soon came to be understood, wherever he and his wife went, that he had married against the wishes of his exalted relations, and had had much ado to prevail on them to countenance her.</s> <s sid="13" id="ld.c42.s13">He never made the representation, on the contrary seemed to laugh the idea to scorn; but it did happen that, with all his pains to depreciate himself, he was always in the superior position.</s> <s sid="14" id="ld.c42.s14">From the days of their honeymoon, Minnie Gowan felt sensible of being usually regarded as the wife of a man who had made a descent in marrying her, but whose chivalrous love for her had cancelled that inequality.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="ld.c42.p6" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="ld.c42.s15">To Venice they had been accompanied by Monsieur Blandois of Paris, and at Venice Monsieur Blandois of Paris was very much in the society of Gowan.</s> <s sid="16" id="ld.c42.s16">When they had first met this gallant gentleman at Geneva, Gowan had been undecided whether to kick him or encourage him; and had remained for about four-and-twenty hours, so troubled to settle the point to his satisfaction, that he had thought of tossing up a five-franc piece on the terms, <qs/>'Tails, kick; heads, encourage,'<qe/> and abiding by the voice of the oracle.</s> <s sid="17" id="ld.c42.s17">It chanced, however, that his wife expressed a dislike to the engaging Blandois, and that the balance of feeling in the hotel was against him.</s> <s sid="18" id="ld.c42.s18">Upon it, Gowan resolved to encourage him.</s> </p><p pid="7" id="ld.c42.p7"><s sid="19" id="ld.c42.s19">Why this perversity, if it were not in a generous fit?--which it was not.</s> <s sid="20" id="ld.c42.s20">Why should Gowan, very much the superior of Blandois of Paris, and very well able to pull that prepossessing gentleman to pieces and find out the stuff he was made of, take up with such a man?</s> <s sid="21" id="ld.c42.s21">In the first place, he opposed the first separate wish he observed in his wife, because her father had paid his debts and it was desirable to take an early opportunity of asserting his independence.</s> <s sid="22" id="ld.c42.s22">In the second place, he opposed the prevalent feeling, because with many capacities of being otherwise, he was an ill-conditioned man.</s> <s sid="23" id="ld.c42.s23">He found a pleasure in declaring that a courtier with the refined manners of Blandois ought to rise to the greatest distinction in any polished country.</s> <s sid="24" id="ld.c42.s24">He found a pleasure in setting up Blandois as the type of elegance, and making him a satire upon others who piqued themselves on personal graces.</s> <s sid="25" id="ld.c42.s25">He seriously protested that the bow of Blandois was perfect, that the address of Blandois was irresistible, and that the picturesque ease of Blandois would be cheaply purchased (if it were not a gift, and unpurchasable) for a hundred thousand francs.</s> <s sid="26" id="ld.c42.s26">That exaggeration in the manner of the man which has been noticed as appertaining to him and to every such man, whatever his original breeding, as certainly as the sun belongs to this system, was acceptable to Gowan as a caricature, which he found it a humorous resource to have at hand for the ridiculing of numbers of people who necessarily did more or less of what Blandois overdid.</s> <s sid="27" id="ld.c42.s27">Thus he had taken up with him; and thus, negligently strengthening these inclinations with habit, and idly deriving some amusement from his talk, he had glided into a way of having him for a companion.</s> <s sid="28" id="ld.c42.s28">This, though he supposed him to live by his wits at play-tables and the like; though he suspected him to be a coward, while he himself was daring and courageous; though he thoroughly knew him to be disliked by Minnie; and though he cared so little for him, after all, that if he had given her any tangible personal cause to regard him with aversion, he would have had no compunction whatever in flinging him out of the highest window in Venice into the deepest water of the city.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="ld.c42.p8" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="ld.c42.s29">Little Dorrit would have been glad to make her visit to Mrs Gowan, alone; but as Fanny, who had not yet recovered from her Uncle's protest, though it was four-and-twenty hours of age, pressingly offered her company, the two sisters stepped together into one of the gondolas under Mr Dorrit's window, and, with the courier in attendance, were taken in high state to Mrs Gowan's lodging.</s> <s sid="30" id="ld.c42.s30">In truth, their state was rather too high for the lodging, which was, as Fanny complained, <qs/>'fearfully out of the way,'<qe/><sls/> and which took them through a complexity of narrow streets of water, which the same lady disparaged as <sle/><qs/>'mere ditches.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="9" id="ld.c42.p9"><s sid="31" id="ld.c42.s31">The house, on a little desert island, looked as if it had broken away from somewhere else, and had floated by chance into its present anchorage in company with a vine almost as much in want of training as the poor wretches who were lying under its leaves.</s> <s sid="32" id="ld.c42.s32">The features of the surrounding picture were, a church with hoarding and scaffolding about it, which had been under suppositious repair so long that the means of repair looked a hundred years old, and had themselves fallen into decay; a quantity of washed linen, spread to dry in the sun; a number of houses at odds with one another and grotesquely out of the perpendicular, like rotten pre- Adamite cheeses cut into fantastic shapes and full of mites; and a feverish bewilderment of windows, with their lattice-blinds all hanging askew, and something draggled and dirty dangling out of most of them.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="ld.c42.p10"><s sid="33" id="ld.c42.s33">On the first-floor of the house was a Bank--a surprising experience for any gentleman of commercial pursuits bringing laws for all mankind from a British city--where two spare clerks, like dried dragoons, in green velvet caps adorned with golden tassels, stood, bearded, behind a small counter in a small room, containing no other visible objects than an empty iron-safe with the door open, a jug of water, and a papering of garland of roses; but who, on lawful requisition, by merely dipping their hands out of sight, could produce exhaustless mounds of five-franc pieces.</s> <s sid="34" id="ld.c42.s34">Below the Bank was a suite of three or four rooms with barred windows, which had the appearance of a jail for criminal rats.</s> <s sid="35" id="ld.c42.s35">Above the Bank was Mrs Gowan's residence.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="ld.c42.p11"><s sid="36" id="ld.c42.s36">Notwithstanding that its walls were blotched, as if missionary maps were bursting out of them to impart geographical knowledge; notwithstanding that its weird furniture was forlornly faded and musty, and that the prevailing Venetian odour of bilge water and an ebb tide on a weedy shore was very strong; the place was better within, than it promised.</s> <s sid="37" id="ld.c42.s37">The door was opened by a smiling man like a reformed assassin--a temporary servant--who ushered them into the room where Mrs Gowan sat, with the announcement that two beautiful English ladies were come to see the mistress.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 11 A Letter from Little Dorrit</title>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c47.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c47.s1">Dear Mr Clennam,</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c47.p2"><s sid="2" id="ld.c47.s2">As I said in my last that it was best for nobody to write to me, and as my sending you another little letter can therefore give you no other trouble than the trouble of reading it (perhaps you may not find leisure for even that, though I hope you will some day), I am now going to devote an hour to writing to you again.</s> <s sid="3" id="ld.c47.s3">This time, I write from Rome.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ld.c47.p3"><s sid="4" id="ld.c47.s4">We left Venice before Mr and Mrs Gowan did, but they were not so long upon the road as we were, and did not travel by the same way, and so when we arrived we found them in a lodging here, in a place called the Via Gregoriana.</s> <s sid="5" id="ld.c47.s5">I dare say you know it.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="ld.c47.p4"><s sid="6" id="ld.c47.s6">Now I am going to tell you all I can about them, because I know that is what you most want to hear.</s> <s sid="7" id="ld.c47.s7">Theirs is not a very comfortable lodging, but perhaps I thought it less so when I first saw it than you would have done, because you have been in many different countries and have seen many different customs.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c47.s8">Of course it is a far, far better place--millions of times--than any I have ever been used to until lately; and I fancy I don't look at it with my own eyes, but with hers.</s> <s sid="9" id="ld.c47.s9">For it would be easy to see that she has always been brought up in a tender and happy home, even if she had not told me so with great love for it.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="ld.c47.p5"><s sid="10" id="ld.c47.s10">Well, it is a rather bare lodging up a rather dark common staircase, and it is nearly all a large dull room, where Mr Gowan paints.</s> <s sid="11" id="ld.c47.s11">The windows are blocked up where any one could look out, and the walls have been all drawn over with chalk and charcoal by others who have lived there before--oh,--I should think, for years!</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="ld.c47.p6"><s sid="12" id="ld.c47.s12">There is a curtain more dust-coloured than red, which divides it, and the part behind the curtain makes the private sitting-room.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="ld.c47.p7"><s sid="13" id="ld.c47.s13">When I first saw her there she was alone, and her work had fallen out of her hand, and she was looking up at the sky shining through the tops of the windows.</s> <s sid="14" id="ld.c47.s14">Pray do not be uneasy when I tell you, but it was not quite so airy, nor so bright, nor so cheerful, nor so happy and youthful altogether as I should have liked it to be.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="ld.c47.p8"><s sid="15" id="ld.c47.s15">On account of Mr Gowan's painting Papa's picture (which I am not quite convinced I should have known from the likeness if I had not seen him doing it), I have had more opportunities of being with her since then than I might have had without this fortunate chance.</s> <s sid="16" id="ld.c47.s16">She is very much alone.</s> <s sid="17" id="ld.c47.s17">Very much alone indeed.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="ld.c47.p9" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="ld.c47.s18">Shall I tell you about the second time I saw her?</s> <s sid="19" id="ld.c47.s19">I went one day, when it happened that I could run round by myself, at four or five o'clock in the afternoon.</s> <s sid="20" id="ld.c47.s20">She was then dining alone, and her solitary dinner had been brought in from somewhere, over a kind of brazier with a fire in it, and she had no company or prospect of company, that I could see, but the old man who had brought it.</s> <s sid="21" id="ld.c47.s21">He was telling her a long story (of robbers outside the walls being taken up by a stone statue of a Saint), to entertain her--as he said to me when I came out, <qs/>'because he had a daughter of his own, though she was not so pretty.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="10" id="ld.c47.p10"><s sid="22" id="ld.c47.s22">I ought now to mention Mr Gowan, before I say what little more I have to say about her.</s> <s sid="23" id="ld.c47.s23">He must admire her beauty, and he must be proud of her, for everybody praises it, and he must be fond of her, and I do not doubt that he is--but in his way.</s> <s sid="24" id="ld.c47.s24">You know his way, and if it appears as careless and discontented in your eyes as it does in mine, I am not wrong in thinking that it might be better suited to her.</s> <s sid="25" id="ld.c47.s25">If it does not seem so to you, I am quite sure I am wholly mistaken; for your unchanged poor child confides in your knowledge and goodness more than she could ever tell you if she was to try.</s> <s sid="26" id="ld.c47.s26">But don't be frightened, I am not going to try.</s> <s sid="27" id="ld.c47.s27">Owing (as I think, if you think so too) to Mr Gowan's unsettled and dissatisfied way, he applies himself to his profession very little.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="ld.c47.p11"><s sid="28" id="ld.c47.s28">He does nothing steadily or patiently; but equally takes things up and throws them down, and does them, or leaves them undone, without caring about them.</s> <s sid="29" id="ld.c47.s29">When I have heard him talking to Papa during the sittings for the picture, I have sat wondering whether it could be that he has no belief in anybody else, because he has no belief in himself.</s> <s sid="30" id="ld.c47.s30">Is it so?</s> <s sid="31" id="ld.c47.s31">I wonder what you will say when you come to this!</s> <s sid="32" id="ld.c47.s32">I know how you will look, and I can almost hear the voice in which you would tell me on the Iron Bridge.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="ld.c47.p12"><s sid="33" id="ld.c47.s33">Mr Gowan goes out a good deal among what is considered the best company here--though he does not look as if he enjoyed it or liked it when he is with it--and she sometimes accompanies him, but lately she has gone out very little.</s> <s sid="34" id="ld.c47.s34">I think I have noticed that they have an inconsistent way of speaking about her, as if she had made some great self-interested success in marrying Mr Gowan, though, at the same time, the very same people, would not have dreamed of taking him for themselves or their daughters.</s> <s sid="35" id="ld.c47.s35">Then he goes into the country besides, to think about making sketches; and in all places where there are visitors, he has a large acquaintance and is very well known.</s> <s sid="36" id="ld.c47.s36">Besides all this, he has a friend who is much in his society both at home and away from home, though he treats this friend very coolly and is very uncertain in his behaviour to him.</s> <s sid="37" id="ld.c47.s37">I am quite sure (because she has told me so), that she does not like this friend.</s> <s sid="38" id="ld.c47.s38">He is so revolting to me, too, that his being away from here, at present, is quite a relief to my mind.</s> <s sid="39" id="ld.c47.s39">How much more to hers!</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="ld.c47.p13"><s sid="40" id="ld.c47.s40">But what I particularly want you to know, and why I have resolved to tell you so much while I am afraid it may make you a little uncomfortable without occasion, is this.</s> <s sid="41" id="ld.c47.s41">She is so true and so devoted, and knows so completely that all her love and duty are his for ever, that you may be certain she will love him, admire him, praise him, and conceal all his faults, until she dies.</s> <s sid="42" id="ld.c47.s42">I believe she conceals them, and always will conceal them, even from herself.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="ld.c47.p14"><s sid="43" id="ld.c47.s43">She has given him a heart that can never be taken back; and however much he may try it, he will never wear out its affection.</s> <s sid="44" id="ld.c47.s44">You know the truth of this, as you know everything, far far better than I; but I cannot help telling you what a nature she shows, and that you can never think too well of her.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="ld.c47.p15"><s sid="45" id="ld.c47.s45">I have not yet called her by her name in this letter, but we are such friends now that I do so when we are quietly together, and she speaks to me by my name--I mean, not my Christian name, but the name you gave me.</s> <s sid="46" id="ld.c47.s46">When she began to call me Amy, I told her my short story, and that you had always called me Little Dorrit.</s> <s sid="47" id="ld.c47.s47">I told her that the name was much dearer to me than any other, and so she calls me Little Dorrit too.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="ld.c47.p16"><s sid="48" id="ld.c47.s48">Perhaps you have not heard from her father or mother yet, and may not know that she has a baby son.</s> <s sid="49" id="ld.c47.s49">He was born only two days ago, and just a week after they came.</s> <s sid="50" id="ld.c47.s50">It has made them very happy.</s> <s sid="51" id="ld.c47.s51">However, I must tell you, as I am to tell you all, that I fancy they are under a constraint with Mr Gowan, and that they feel as if his mocking way with them was sometimes a slight given to their love for her.</s> <s sid="52" id="ld.c47.s52">It was but yesterday, when I was there, that I saw Mr Meagles change colour, and get up and go out, as if he was afraid that he might say so, unless he prevented himself by that means.</s> <s sid="53" id="ld.c47.s53">Yet I am sure they are both so considerate, good-humoured, and reasonable, that he might spare them.</s> <s sid="54" id="ld.c47.s54">It is hard in him not to think of them a little more.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="ld.c47.p17"><s sid="55" id="ld.c47.s55">I stopped at the last full stop to read all this over.</s> <s sid="56" id="ld.c47.s56">It looked at first as if I was taking on myself to understand and explain so much, that I was half inclined not to send it.</s> <s sid="57" id="ld.c47.s57">But when I thought it over a little, I felt more hopeful for your knowing at once that I had only been watchful for you, and had only noticed what I think I have noticed, because I was quickened by your interest in it.</s> <s sid="58" id="ld.c47.s58">Indeed, you may be sure that is the truth.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="ld.c47.p18"><s sid="59" id="ld.c47.s59">And now I have done with the subject in the present letter, and have little left to say.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="ld.c47.p19"><s sid="60" id="ld.c47.s60">We are all quite well, and Fanny improves every day.</s> <s sid="61" id="ld.c47.s61">You can hardly think how kind she is to me, and what pains she takes with me.</s> <s sid="62" id="ld.c47.s62">She has a lover, who has followed her, first all the way from Switzerland, and then all the way from Venice, and who has just confided to me that he means to follow her everywhere.</s> <s sid="63" id="ld.c47.s63">I was much confused by his speaking to me about it, but he would.</s> <s sid="64" id="ld.c47.s64">I did not know what to say, but at last I told him that I thought he had better not.</s> <s sid="65" id="ld.c47.s65">For Fanny (but I did not tell him this) is much too spirited and clever to suit him.</s> <s sid="66" id="ld.c47.s66">Still, he said he would, all the same.</s> <s sid="67" id="ld.c47.s67">I have no lover, of course.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="ld.c47.p20"><s sid="68" id="ld.c47.s68">If you should ever get so far as this in this long letter, you will perhaps say, Surely Little Dorrit will not leave off without telling me something about her travels, and surely it is time she did.</s> <s sid="69" id="ld.c47.s69">I think it is indeed, but I don't know what to tell you.</s> <s sid="70" id="ld.c47.s70">Since we left Venice we have been in a great many wonderful places, Genoa and Florence among them, and have seen so many wonderful sights, that I am almost giddy when I think what a crowd they make.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="ld.c47.p21"><s sid="71" id="ld.c47.s71">But you can tell me so much more about them than I can tell you, that why should I tire you with my accounts and descriptions?</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="ld.c47.p22" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="ld.c47.s72">Dear Mr Clennam, as I had the courage to tell you what the familiar difficulties in my travelling mind were before, I will not be a coward now.</s> <s sid="73" id="ld.c47.s73">One of my frequent thoughts is this:-- Old as these cities are, their age itself is hardly so curious, to my reflections, as that they should have been in their places all through those days when I did not even know of the existence of more than two or three of them, and when I scarcely knew of anything outside our old walls.</s> <s sid="74" id="ld.c47.s74">There is something melancholy in it, and I don't know why.</s> <s sid="75" id="ld.c47.s75">When we went to see the famous leaning tower at Pisa, it was a bright sunny day, and it and the buildings near it looked so old, and the earth and the sky looked so young, and its shadow on the ground was so soft and retired!</s> <s sid="76" id="ld.c47.s76">I could not at first think how beautiful it was, or how curious, but I thought, <qs/>'O how many times when the shadow of the wall was falling on our room, and when that weary tread of feet was going up and down the yard--O how many times this place was just as quiet and lovely as it is to-day!'<qe/></s> <s sid="77" id="ld.c47.s77">It quite overpowered me.</s> <s sid="78" id="ld.c47.s78">My heart was so full that tears burst out of my eyes, though I did what I could to restrain them.</s> <s sid="79" id="ld.c47.s79">And I have the same feeling often--often.</s> </p><p pid="23" id="ld.c47.p23"><s sid="80" id="ld.c47.s80">Do you know that since the change in our fortunes, though I appear to myself to have dreamed more than before, I have always dreamed of myself as very young indeed!</s> <s sid="81" id="ld.c47.s81">I am not very old, you may say.</s> <s sid="82" id="ld.c47.s82">No, but that is not what I mean.</s> <s sid="83" id="ld.c47.s83">I have always dreamed of myself as a child learning to do needlework.</s> <s sid="84" id="ld.c47.s84">I have often dreamed of myself as back there, seeing faces in the yard little known, and which I should have thought I had quite forgotten; but, as often as not, I have been abroad here--in Switzerland, or France, or Italy-- somewhere where we have been--yet always as that little child.</s> <s sid="85" id="ld.c47.s85">I have dreamed of going down to Mrs General, with the patches on my clothes in which I can first remember myself.</s> <s sid="86" id="ld.c47.s86">I have over and over again dreamed of taking my place at dinner at Venice when we have had a large company, in the mourning for my poor mother which I wore when I was eight years old, and wore long after it was threadbare and would mend no more.</s> <s sid="87" id="ld.c47.s87">It has been a great distress to me to think how irreconcilable the company would consider it with my father's wealth, and how I should displease and disgrace him and Fanny and Edward by so plainly disclosing what they wished to keep secret.</s> <s sid="88" id="ld.c47.s88">But I have not grown out of the little child in thinking of it; and at the self-same moment I have dreamed that I have sat with the heart-ache at table, calculating the expenses of the dinner, and quite distracting myself with thinking how they were ever to be made good.</s> <s sid="89" id="ld.c47.s89">I have never dreamed of the change in our fortunes itself; I have never dreamed of your coming back with me that memorable morning to break it; I have never even dreamed of you.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="ld.c48.p5"><s sid="31" id="ld.c48.s31">Mrs Merdle had written to this magnificent spouse of hers, whom it was heresy to regard as anything less than all the British Merchants since the days of Whittington rolled into one, and gilded three feet deep all over--had written to this spouse of hers, several letters from Rome, in quick succession, urging upon him with importunity that now or never was the time to provide for Edmund Sparkler.</s> <s sid="32" id="ld.c48.s32">Mrs Merdle had shown him that the case of Edmund was urgent, and that infinite advantages might result from his having some good thing directly.</s> <s sid="33" id="ld.c48.s33">In the grammar of Mrs Merdle's verbs on this momentous subject, there was only one mood, the Imperative; and that Mood had only one Tense, the Present.</s> <s sid="34" id="ld.c48.s34">Mrs Merdle's verbs were so pressingly presented to Mr Merdle to conjugate, that his sluggish blood and his long coat-cuffs became quite agitated.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="ld.c48.p7"><s sid="37" id="ld.c48.s37">Mr Merdle stood in one of his drawing-rooms, with his back to the fire, waiting for the arrival of his important guests.</s> <s sid="38" id="ld.c48.s38">He seldom or never took the liberty of standing with his back to the fire unless he was quite alone.</s> <s sid="39" id="ld.c48.s39">In the presence of the Chief Butler, he could not have done such a deed.</s> <s sid="40" id="ld.c48.s40">He would have clasped himself by the wrists in that constabulary manner of his, and have paced up and down the hearthrug, or gone creeping about among the rich objects of furniture, if his oppressive retainer had appeared in the room at that very moment.</s> <s sid="41" id="ld.c48.s41">The sly shadows which seemed to dart out of hiding when the fire rose, and to dart back into it when the fire fell, were sufficient witnesses of his making himself so easy.</s> </p>

<p pid="66" id="ld.c54.p66"><s sid="151" id="ld.c54.s151">Arrived at Paris, and resting there three days, Mr Dorrit strolled much about the streets alone, looking in at the shop-windows, and particularly the jewellers' windows.</s> <s sid="152" id="ld.c54.s152">Ultimately, he went into the most famous jeweller's, and said he wanted to buy a little gift for a lady.</s> </p>

<p pid="67" id="ld.c54.p67"><s sid="153" id="ld.c54.s153">It was a charming little woman to whom he said it--a sprightly little woman, dressed in perfect taste, who came out of a green velvet bower to attend upon him, from posting up some dainty little books of account which one could hardly suppose to be ruled for the entry of any articles more commercial than kisses, at a dainty little shining desk which looked in itself like a sweetmeat.</s> </p>

<p pid="68" id="ld.c54.p68"><s sid="154" id="ld.c54.s154">For example, then, said the little woman, what species of gift did Monsieur desire?</s> <s sid="155" id="ld.c54.s155">A love-gift?</s> </p>

<p pid="69" id="ld.c54.p69"><s sid="156" id="ld.c54.s156">Mr Dorrit smiled, and said, Eh, well!</s> <s sid="157" id="ld.c54.s157">Perhaps.</s> <s sid="158" id="ld.c54.s158">What did he know?</s> <s sid="159" id="ld.c54.s159">It was always possible; the sex being so charming.</s> <s sid="160" id="ld.c54.s160">Would she show him some?</s> </p>

<p pid="70" id="ld.c54.p70"><s sid="161" id="ld.c54.s161">Most willingly, said the little woman.</s> <s sid="162" id="ld.c54.s162">Flattered and enchanted to show him many.</s> <s sid="163" id="ld.c54.s163">But pardon!</s> <s sid="164" id="ld.c54.s164">To begin with, he would have the great goodness to observe that there were love-gifts, and there were nuptial gifts.</s> <s sid="165" id="ld.c54.s165">For example, these ravishing ear-rings and this necklace so superb to correspond, were what one called a love- gift.</s> <s sid="166" id="ld.c54.s166">These brooches and these rings, of a beauty so gracious and celestial, were what one called, with the permission of Monsieur, nuptial gifts.</s> </p>

<p pid="71" id="ld.c54.p71"><s sid="167" id="ld.c54.s167">Perhaps it would be a good arrangement, Mr Dorrit hinted, smiling, to purchase both, and to present the love-gift first, and to finish with the nuptial offering?</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="ld.c54.p72"><s sid="168" id="ld.c54.s168">Ah Heaven!  said the little woman, laying the tips of the fingers of her two little hands against each other, that would be generous indeed, that would be a special gallantry!</s> <s sid="169" id="ld.c54.s169">And without doubt the lady so crushed with gifts would find them irresistible.</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="ld.c54.p73"><s sid="170" id="ld.c54.s170">Mr Dorrit was not sure of that.</s> <s sid="171" id="ld.c54.s171">But, for example, the sprightly little woman was very sure of it, she said.</s> <s sid="172" id="ld.c54.s172">So Mr Dorrit bought a gift of each sort, and paid handsomely for it.</s> <s sid="173" id="ld.c54.s173">As he strolled back to his hotel afterwards, he carried his head high: having plainly got up his castle now to a much loftier altitude than the two square towers of Notre Dame.</s> </p>

<p pid="74" id="ld.c54.p74"><s sid="174" id="ld.c54.s174">Building away with all his might, but reserving the plans of his castle exclusively for his own eye, Mr Dorrit posted away for Marseilles.</s> <s sid="175" id="ld.c54.s175">Building on, building on, busily, busily, from morning to night.</s> <s sid="176" id="ld.c54.s176">Falling asleep, and leaving great blocks of building materials dangling in the air; waking again, to resume work and get them into their places.</s> <s sid="177" id="ld.c54.s177">What time the Courier in the rumble, smoking Young john's best cigars, left a little thread of thin light smoke behind--perhaps as he built a castle or two with stray pieces of Mr Dorrit's money.</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="ld.c54.p75"><s sid="178" id="ld.c54.s178">Not a fortified town that they passed in all their journey was as strong, not a Cathedral summit was as high, as Mr Dorrit's castle.</s> <s sid="179" id="ld.c54.s179">Neither the Saone nor the Rhone sped with the swiftness of that peerless building; nor was the Mediterranean deeper than its foundations; nor were the distant landscapes on the Cornice road, nor the hills and bay of Genoa the Superb, more beautiful.</s> <s sid="180" id="ld.c54.s180">Mr Dorrit and his matchless castle were disembarked among the dirty white houses and dirtier felons of Civita Vecchia, and thence scrambled on to Rome as they could, through the filth that festered on the way.</s> </p></div>

<title>CHAPTER 19 The Storming of the Castle in the Air</title>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c55.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c55.s1">The sun had gone down full four hours, and it was later than most travellers would like it to be for finding themselves outside the walls of Rome, when Mr Dorrit's carriage, still on its last wearisome stage, rattled over the solitary Campagna.</s> <s sid="2" id="ld.c55.s2">The savage herdsmen and the fierce-looking peasants who had chequered the way while the light lasted, had all gone down with the sun, and left the wilderness blank.</s> <s sid="3" id="ld.c55.s3">At some turns of the road, a pale flare on the horizon, like an exhalation from the ruin-sown land, showed that the city was yet far off; but this poor relief was rare and short-lived.</s> <s sid="4" id="ld.c55.s4">The carriage dipped down again into a hollow of the black dry sea, and for a long time there was nothing visible save its petrified swell and the gloomy sky.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c55.p2"><s sid="5" id="ld.c55.s5">Mr Dorrit, though he had his castle-building to engage his mind, could not be quite easy in that desolate place.</s> <s sid="6" id="ld.c55.s6">He was far more curious, in every swerve of the carriage, and every cry of the postilions, than he had been since he quitted London.</s> <s sid="7" id="ld.c55.s7">The valet on the box evidently quaked.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c55.s8">The Courier in the rumble was not altogether comfortable in his mind.</s> <s sid="9" id="ld.c55.s9">As often as Mr Dorrit let down the glass and looked back at him (which was very often), he saw him smoking John Chivery out, it is true, but still generally standing up the while and looking about him, like a man who had his suspicions, and kept upon his guard.</s> <s sid="10" id="ld.c55.s10">Then would Mr Dorrit, pulling up the glass again, reflect that those postilions were cut-throat looking fellows, and that he would have done better to have slept at Civita Vecchia, and have started betimes in the morning.</s> <s sid="11" id="ld.c55.s11">But, for all this, he worked at his castle in the intervals.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ld.c55.p3"><s sid="12" id="ld.c55.s12">And now, fragments of ruinous enclosure, yawning window-gap and crazy wall, deserted houses, leaking wells, broken water-tanks, spectral cypress-trees, patches of tangled vine, and the changing of the track to a long, irregular, disordered lane where everything was crumbling away, from the unsightly buildings to the jolting road--now, these objects showed that they were nearing Rome.</s> <s sid="13" id="ld.c55.s13">And now, a sudden twist and stoppage of the carriage inspired Mr Dorrit with the mistrust that the brigand moment was come for twisting him into a ditch and robbing him; until, letting down the glass again and looking out, he perceived himself assailed by nothing worse than a funeral procession, which came mechanically chaunting by, with an indistinct show of dirty vestments, lurid torches, swinging censers, and a great cross borne before a priest.</s> <s sid="14" id="ld.c55.s14">He was an ugly priest by torchlight; of a lowering aspect, with an overhanging brow; and as his eyes met those of Mr Dorrit, looking bareheaded out of the carriage, his lips, moving as they chaunted, seemed to threaten that important traveller; likewise the action of his hand, which was in fact his manner of returning the traveller's salutation, seemed to come in aid of that menace.</s> <s sid="15" id="ld.c55.s15">So thought Mr Dorrit, made fanciful by the weariness of building and travelling, as the priest drifted past him, and the procession straggled away, taking its dead along with it.</s> <s sid="16" id="ld.c55.s16">Upon their so-different way went Mr Dorrit's company too; and soon, with their coach load of luxuries from the two great capitals of Europe, they were (like the Goths reversed) beating at the gates of Rome.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="ld.c55.p4"><s sid="17" id="ld.c55.s17">Mr Dorrit was not expected by his own people that night.</s> <s sid="18" id="ld.c55.s18">He had been; but they had given him up until to-morrow, not doubting that it was later than he would care, in those parts, to be out.</s> <s sid="19" id="ld.c55.s19">Thus, when his equipage stopped at his own gate, no one but the porter appeared to receive him.</s> <s sid="20" id="ld.c55.s20">Was Miss Dorrit from home?  he asked.</s> <s sid="21" id="ld.c55.s21">No.  She was within.</s> <s sid="22" id="ld.c55.s22">Good, said Mr Dorrit to the assembling servants; let them keep where they were; let them help to unload the carriage; he would find Miss Dorrit for himself.</s> <s sid="23" id="ld.c55.s23">So he went up his grand staircase, slowly, and tired, and looked into various chambers which were empty, until he saw a light in a small ante-room.</s> <s sid="24" id="ld.c55.s24">It was a curtained nook, like a tent, within two other rooms; and it looked warm and bright in colour, as he approached it through the dark avenue they made.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c59.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c59.s1">Left alone, with the expressive looks and gestures of Mr Baptist, otherwise Giovanni Baptista Cavalletto, vividly before him, Clennam entered on a weary day.</s> <s sid="2" id="ld.c59.s2">It was in vain that he tried to control his attention by directing it to any business occupation or train of thought; it rode at anchor by the haunting topic, and would hold to no other idea.</s> <s sid="3" id="ld.c59.s3">As though a criminal should be chained in a stationary boat on a deep clear river, condemned, whatever countless leagues of water flowed past him, always to see the body of the fellow-creature he had drowned lying at the bottom, immovable, and unchangeable, except as the eddies made it broad or long, now expanding, now contracting its terrible lineaments; so Arthur, below the shifting current of transparent thoughts and fancies which were gone and succeeded by others as soon as come, saw, steady and dark, and not to be stirred from its place, the one subject that he endeavoured with all his might to rid himself of, and that he could not fly from.</s> <s sid="4" id="ld.c59.s4">The assurance he now had, that Blandois, whatever his right name, was one of the worst of characters, greatly augmented the burden of his anxieties.</s> <s sid="5" id="ld.c59.s5">Though the disappearance should be accounted for to-morrow, the fact that his mother had been in communication with such a man, would remain unalterable.</s> <s sid="6" id="ld.c59.s6">That the communication had been of a secret kind, and that she had been submissive to him and afraid of him, he hoped might be known to no one beyond himself; yet, knowing it, how could he separate it from his old vague fears, and how believe that there was nothing evil in such relations?</s> <s sid="7" id="ld.c59.s7">Her resolution not to enter on the question with him, and his knowledge of her indomitable character, enhanced his sense of helplessness.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c59.s8">It was like the oppression of a dream to believe that shame and exposure were impending over her and his father's memory, and to be shut out, as by a brazen wall, from the possibility of coming to their aid.</s> <s sid="9" id="ld.c59.s9">The purpose he had brought home to his native country, and had ever since kept in view, was, with her greatest determination, defeated by his mother herself, at the time of all others when he feared that it pressed most.</s> <s sid="10" id="ld.c59.s10">His advice, energy, activity, money, credit, all his resources whatsoever, were all made useless.</s> <s sid="11" id="ld.c59.s11">If she had been possessed of the old fabled influence, and had turned those who looked upon her into stone, she could not have rendered him more completely powerless (so it seemed to him in his distress of mind) than she did, when she turned her unyielding face to his in her gloomy room.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c59.p2"><s sid="12" id="ld.c59.s12">But the light of that day's discovery, shining on these considerations, roused him to take a more decided course of action.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ld.c59.p3"><s sid="13" id="ld.c59.s13">Confident in the rectitude of his purpose, and impelled by a sense of overhanging danger closing in around, he resolved, if his mother would still admit of no approach, to make a desperate appeal to Affery.</s> <s sid="14" id="ld.c59.s14">If she could be brought to become communicative, and to do what lay in her to break the spell of secrecy that enshrouded the house, he might shake off the paralysis of which every hour that passed over his head made him more acutely sensible.</s> <s sid="15" id="ld.c59.s15">This was the result of his day's anxiety, and this was the decision he put in practice when the day closed in.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="ld.c59.p4"><s sid="16" id="ld.c59.s16">His first disappointment, on arriving at the house, was to find the door open, and Mr Flintwinch smoking a pipe on the steps.</s> <s sid="17" id="ld.c59.s17">If circumstances had been commonly favourable, Mistress Affery would have opened the door to his knock.</s> <s sid="18" id="ld.c59.s18">Circumstances being uncommonly unfavourable, the door stood open, and Mr Flintwinch was smoking his pipe on the steps.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="ld.c59.p12"><s sid="26" id="ld.c59.s26">He looked so grim, as he stood askew, with the knot of his cravat under his ear, that the thought passed into Clennam's mind, and not for the first time by many, could Flintwinch for a purpose of his own have got rid of Blandois?</s> <s sid="27" id="ld.c59.s27">Could it have been his secret, and his safety, that were at issue?</s> <s sid="28" id="ld.c59.s28">He was small and bent, and perhaps not actively strong; yet he was as tough as an old yew-tree, and as crusty as an old jackdaw.</s> <s sid="29" id="ld.c59.s29">Such a man, coming behind a much younger and more vigorous man, and having the will to put an end to him and no relenting, might do it pretty surely in that solitary place at a late hour.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="ld.c59.p13"><s sid="30" id="ld.c59.s30">While, in the morbid condition of his thoughts, these thoughts drifted over the main one that was always in Clennam's mind, Mr Flintwinch, regarding the opposite house over the gateway with his neck twisted and one eye shut up, stood smoking with a vicious expression upon him; more as if he were trying to bite off the stem of his pipe, than as if he were enjoying it.</s> <s sid="31" id="ld.c59.s31">Yet he was enjoying it in his own way.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="ld.c59.p28"><s sid="58" id="ld.c59.s58">Flora had spread her bonnet and shawl upon the bed, with a care indicative of an intention to stay some time.</s> <s sid="59" id="ld.c59.s59">Mr Casby, too, was beaming near the hob, with his benevolent knobs shining as if the warm butter of the toast were exuding through the patriarchal skull, and with his face as ruddy as if the colouring matter of the anchovy paste were mantling in the patriarchal visage.</s> <s sid="60" id="ld.c59.s60">Seeing this, as he exchanged the usual salutations, Clennam decided to speak to his mother without postponement.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="ld.c59.p29"><s sid="61" id="ld.c59.s61">It had long been customary, as she never changed her room, for those who had anything to say to her apart, to wheel her to her desk; where she sat, usually with the back of her chair turned towards the rest of the room, and the person who talked with her seated in a corner, on a stool which was always set in that place for that purpose.</s> <s sid="62" id="ld.c59.s62">Except that it was long since the mother and son had spoken together without the intervention of a third person, it was an ordinary matter of course within the experience of visitors for Mrs Clennam to be asked, with a word of apology for the interruption, if she could be spoken with on a matter of business, and, on her replying in the affirmative, to be wheeled into the position described.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="ld.c59.p30"><s sid="63" id="ld.c59.s63">Therefore, when Arthur now made such an apology, and such a request, and moved her to her desk and seated himself on the stool, Mrs Finching merely began to talk louder and faster, as a delicate hint that she could overhear nothing, and Mr Casby stroked his long white locks with sleepy calmness.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="ld.c69.p1"><s sid="1" id="ld.c69.s1">The changes of a fevered room are slow and fluctuating; but the changes of the fevered world are rapid and irrevocable.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ld.c69.p2"><s sid="2" id="ld.c69.s2">It was Little Dorrit's lot to wait upon both kinds of change.</s> <s sid="3" id="ld.c69.s3">The Marshalsea walls, during a portion of every day, again embraced her in their shadows as their child, while she thought for Clennam, worked for him, watched him, and only left him, still to devote her utmost love and care to him.</s> <s sid="4" id="ld.c69.s4">Her part in the life outside the gate urged its pressing claims upon her too, and her patience untiringly responded to them.</s> <s sid="5" id="ld.c69.s5">Here was Fanny, proud, fitful, whimsical, further advanced in that disqualified state for going into society which had so much fretted her on the evening of the tortoise-shell knife, resolved always to want comfort, resolved not to be comforted, resolved to be deeply wronged, and resolved that nobody should have the audacity to think her so.</s> <s sid="6" id="ld.c69.s6">Here was her brother, a weak, proud, tipsy, young old man, shaking from head to foot, talking as indistinctly as if some of the money he plumed himself upon had got into his mouth and couldn't be got out, unable to walk alone in any act of his life, and patronising the sister whom he selfishly loved (he always had that negative merit, ill-starred and ill-launched Tip!) because he suffered her to lead him.</s> <s sid="7" id="ld.c69.s7">Here was Mrs Merdle in gauzy mourning--the original cap whereof had possibly been rent to pieces in a fit of grief, but had certainly yielded to a highly becoming article from the Parisian market--warring with Fanny foot to foot, and breasting her with her desolate bosom every hour in the day.</s> <s sid="8" id="ld.c69.s8">Here was poor Mr Sparkler, not knowing how to keep the peace between them, but humbly inclining to the opinion that they could do no better than agree that they were both remarkably fine women, and that there was no nonsense about either of them--for which gentle recommendation they united in falling upon him frightfully.</s> <s sid="9" id="ld.c69.s9">Then, too, here was Mrs General, got home from foreign parts, sending a Prune and a Prism by post every other day, demanding a new Testimonial by way of recommendation to some vacant appointment or other.</s> <s sid="10" id="ld.c69.s10">Of which remarkable gentlewoman it may be finally observed, that there surely never was a gentlewoman of whose transcendent fitness for any vacant appointment on the face of this earth, so many people were (as the warmth of her Testimonials evinced) so perfectly satisfied--or who was so very unfortunate in having a large circle of ardent and distinguished admirers, who never themselves happened to want her in any capacity.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ld.c69.p3"><s sid="11" id="ld.c69.s11">On the first crash of the eminent Mr Merdle's decease, many important persons had been unable to determine whether they should cut Mrs Merdle, or comfort her.</s> <s sid="12" id="ld.c69.s12">As it seemed, however, essential to the strength of their own case that they should admit her to have been cruelly deceived, they graciously made the admission, and continued to know her.</s> <s sid="13" id="ld.c69.s13">It followed that Mrs Merdle, as a woman of fashion and good breeding who had been sacrificed to the wiles of a vulgar barbarian (for Mr Merdle was found out from the crown of his head to the sole of his foot, the moment he was found out in his pocket), must be actively championed by her order for her order's sake.</s> <s sid="14" id="ld.c69.s14">She returned this fealty by causing it to be understood that she was even more incensed against the felonious shade of the deceased than anybody else was; thus, on the whole, she came out of her furnace like a wise woman, and did exceedingly well.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="ld.c69.p4"><s sid="15" id="ld.c69.s15">Mr Sparkler's lordship was fortunately one of those shelves on which a gentleman is considered to be put away for life, unless there should be reasons for hoisting him up with the Barnacle crane to a more lucrative height.</s> <s sid="16" id="ld.c69.s16">That patriotic servant accordingly stuck to his colours (the Standard of four Quarterings), and was a perfect Nelson in respect of nailing them to the mast.</s> <s sid="17" id="ld.c69.s17">On the profits of his intrepidity, Mrs Sparkler and Mrs Merdle, inhabiting different floors of the genteel little temple of inconvenience to which the smell of the day before yesterday's soup and coach-horses was as constant as Death to man, arrayed themselves to fight it out in the lists of Society, sworn rivals.</s> <s sid="18" id="ld.c69.s18">And Little Dorrit, seeing all these things as they developed themselves, could not but wonder, anxiously, into what back corner of the genteel establishment Fanny's children would be poked by-and-by, and who would take care of those unborn little victims.</s> </p>
