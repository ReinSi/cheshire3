<title>CHAPTER 1. Dombey and Son</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c1.s1">Dombey sat in the corner of the darkened room in the great arm-chair by the bedside, and Son lay tucked up warm in a little basket bedstead, carefully disposed on a low settee immediately in front of the fire and close to it, as if his constitution were analogous to that of a muffin, and it was essential to toast him brown while he was very new.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="DS.c1.s2">Dombey was about eight-and-forty years of age.</s> <s sid="3" id="DS.c1.s3">Son about eight-and-forty minutes.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c1.s4">Dombey was rather bald, rather red, and though a handsome well-made man, too stern and pompous in appearance, to be prepossessing.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c1.s5">Son was very bald, and very red, and though (of course) an undeniably fine infant, somewhat crushed and spotty in his general effect, as yet.</s> <s sid="6" id="DS.c1.s6">On the brow of Dombey, Time and his brother Care had set some marks, as on a tree that was to come down in good time--remorseless twins they are for striding through their human forests, notching as they go--while the countenance of Son was crossed with a thousand little creases, which the same deceitful Time would take delight in smoothing out and wearing away with the flat part of his scythe, as a preparation of the surface for his deeper operations.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c1.p3"><s sid="7" id="DS.c1.s7">Dombey, exulting in the long-looked-for event, jingled and jingled the heavy gold watch-chain that depended from below his trim blue coat, whereof the buttons sparkled phosphorescently in the feeble rays of the distant fire.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c1.s8">Son, with his little fists curled up and clenched, seemed, in his feeble way, to be squaring at existence for having come upon him so unexpectedly.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="DS.c1.s9"><qs/>'The House will once again, Mrs Dombey,'<qe/><sss/> said Mr Dombey, <sse/><qs/>'be not only in name but in fact Dombey and Son;' and he added, in a tone of luxurious satisfaction, with his eyes half-closed as if he were reading the name in a device of flowers, and inhaling their fragrance at the same time; 'Dom-bey and Son!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="DS.c1.p5" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="DS.c1.s10">The words had such a softening influence, that he appended a term of endearment to Mrs Dombey's name (though not without some hesitation, as being a man but little used to that form of address): and said, <qs/>'Mrs Dombey, my--my dear.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="DS.c1.p6"><s sid="11" id="DS.c1.s11">A transient flush of faint surprise overspread the sick lady's face as she raised her eyes towards him.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DS.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="DS.c1.s12"><qs/>'He will be christened Paul, my--Mrs Dombey--of course.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="8" id="DS.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="DS.c1.s13">She feebly echoed, <qs/>'Of course,'<qe/> or rather expressed it by the motion of her lips, and closed her eyes again.</s> </p><p pid="9" id="DS.c1.p9" type="speech"><s sid="14" id="DS.c1.s14"><qs/>'His father's name, Mrs Dombey, and his grandfather's!</s> <s sid="15" id="DS.c1.s15">I wish his grandfather were alive this day!</s> <s sid="16" id="DS.c1.s16">There is some inconvenience in the necessity of writing Junior,'<qe/><sls/> said Mr Dombey, making a fictitious autograph on his knee; <sle/><qs/>'but it is merely of a private and personal complexion.</s> <s sid="17" id="DS.c1.s17">It doesn't enter into the correspondence of the House.</s> <s sid="18" id="DS.c1.s18">Its signature remains the same.'<qe/></s> <s sid="19" id="DS.c1.s19">And again he said 'Dombey and Son, in exactly the same tone as before.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="DS.c1.p10"><s sid="20" id="DS.c1.s20">Those three words conveyed the one idea of Mr Dombey's life.</s> <s sid="21" id="DS.c1.s21">The earth was made for Dombey and Son to trade in, and the sun and moon were made to give them light.</s> <s sid="22" id="DS.c1.s22">Rivers and seas were formed to float their ships; rainbows gave them promise of fair weather; winds blew for or against their enterprises; stars and planets circled in their orbits, to preserve inviolate a system of which they were the centre.</s> <s sid="23" id="DS.c1.s23">Common abbreviations took new meanings in his eyes, and had sole reference to them.</s> <s sid="24" id="DS.c1.s24">A. D. had no concern with Anno Domini, but stood for anno Dombei--and Son.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="DS.c1.p11"><s sid="25" id="DS.c1.s25">He had risen, as his father had before him, in the course of life and death, from Son to Dombey, and for nearly twenty years had been the sole representative of the Firm.</s> <s sid="26" id="DS.c1.s26">Of those years he had been married, ten--married, as some said, to a lady with no heart to give him; whose happiness was in the past, and who was content to bind her broken spirit to the dutiful and meek endurance of the present.</s> <s sid="27" id="DS.c1.s27">Such idle talk was little likely to reach the ears of Mr Dombey, whom it nearly concerned; and probably no one in the world would have received it with such utter incredulity as he, if it had reached him.</s> <s sid="28" id="DS.c1.s28">Dombey and Son had often dealt in hides, but never in hearts.</s> <s sid="29" id="DS.c1.s29">They left that fancy ware to boys and girls, and boarding-schools and books.</s> <s sid="30" id="DS.c1.s30">Mr Dombey would have reasoned:</s> <s sid="31" id="DS.c1.s31">That a matrimonial alliance with himself must, in the nature of things, be gratifying and honourable to any woman of common sense.</s> <s sid="32" id="DS.c1.s32">That the hope of giving birth to a new partner in such a House, could not fail to awaken a glorious and stirring ambition in the breast of the least ambitious of her sex.</s> <s sid="33" id="DS.c1.s33">That Mrs Dombey had entered on that social contract of matrimony: almost necessarily part of a genteel and wealthy station, even without reference to the perpetuation of family Firms: with her eyes fully open to these advantages.</s> <s sid="34" id="DS.c1.s34">That Mrs Dombey had had daily practical knowledge of his position in society.</s> <s sid="35" id="DS.c1.s35">That Mrs Dombey had always sat at the head of his table, and done the honours of his house in a remarkably lady-like and becoming manner.</s> <s sid="36" id="DS.c1.s36">That Mrs Dombey must have been happy.</s> <s sid="37" id="DS.c1.s37">That she couldn't help it.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="DS.c1.p12"><s sid="38" id="DS.c1.s38">Or, at all events, with one drawback.</s> <s sid="39" id="DS.c1.s39">Yes.</s> <s sid="40" id="DS.c1.s40">That he would have allowed.</s> <s sid="41" id="DS.c1.s41">With only one; but that one certainly involving much.</s> <s sid="42" id="DS.c1.s42">With the drawback of hope deferred.</s> <s sid="43" id="DS.c1.s43">That hope deferred, which, (as the Scripture very correctly tells us, Mr Dombey would have added in a patronising way; for his highest distinct idea even of Scripture, if examined, would have been found to be; that as forming part of a general whole, of which Dombey and Son formed another part, it was therefore to be commended and upheld) maketh the heart sick.</s> <s sid="44" id="DS.c1.s44">They had been married ten years, and until this present day on which Mr Dombey sat jingling and jingling his heavy gold watch-chain in the great arm-chair by the side of the bed, had had no issue.--To speak of; none worth mentioning.</s> <s sid="45" id="DS.c1.s45">There had been a girl some six years before, and the child, who had stolen into the chamber unobserved, was now crouching timidly, in a corner whence she could see her mother's face.</s> <s sid="46" id="DS.c1.s46">But what was a girl to Dombey and Son!</s> <s sid="47" id="DS.c1.s47">In the capital of the House's name and dignity, such a child was merely a piece of base coin that couldn't be invested--a bad Boy--nothing more.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="DS.c1.p13"><s sid="48" id="DS.c1.s48">Mr Dombey's cup of satisfaction was so full at this moment, however, that he felt he could afford a drop or two of its contents, even to sprinkle on the dust in the by-path of his little daughter.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="DS.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="DS.c1.s49">So he said, <qs/>'Florence, you may go and look at your pretty brother, if you like, I daresay.</s> <s sid="50" id="DS.c1.s50">Don't touch him!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="DS.c1.p15"><s sid="51" id="DS.c1.s51">The child glanced keenly at the blue coat and stiff white cravat, which, with a pair of creaking boots and a very loud ticking watch, embodied her idea of a father; but her eyes returned to her mother's face immediately, and she neither moved nor answered.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="DS.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="DS.c1.s52"><qs/>'Her insensibility is as proof against a brother as against every thing else,'<qe/> said Mr Dombey to himself He seemed so confirmed in a previous opinion by the discovery, as to be quite glad of it.'</s> </p><p pid="17" id="DS.c1.p17"><s sid="53" id="DS.c1.s53">Next moment, the lady had opened her eyes and seen the child; and the child had run towards her; and, standing on tiptoe, the better to hide her face in her embrace, had clung about her with a desperate affection very much at variance with her years.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="DS.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="DS.c1.s54"><qs/>'Oh Lord bless me!'<qe/> said Mr Dombey, rising testily.</s> <s sid="55" id="DS.c1.s55"><qs/>'A very illadvised and feverish proceeding this, I am sure.</s> <s sid="56" id="DS.c1.s56">Please to ring there for Miss Florence's nurse.</s> <s sid="57" id="DS.c1.s57">Really the person should be more care-'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="DS.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="DS.c1.s58"><qs/>'Wait!</s> <s sid="59" id="DS.c1.s59">I--had better ask Doctor Peps if he'll have the goodness to step upstairs again perhaps.</s> <s sid="60" id="DS.c1.s60">I'll go down.</s> <s sid="61" id="DS.c1.s61">I'll go down.</s> <s sid="62" id="DS.c1.s62">I needn't beg you,'<qe/><sls/> he added, pausing for a moment at the settee before the fire, <sle/><qs/>'to take particular care of this young gentleman, Mrs ----'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="20" id="DS.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="DS.c1.s63"><qs/>'Blockitt, Sir?'<qe/> suggested the nurse, a simpering piece of faded gentility, who did not presume to state her name as a fact, but merely offered it as a mild suggestion.</s> </p><p pid="21" id="DS.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="DS.c1.s64"><qs/>'Of this young gentleman, Mrs Blockitt.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="22" id="DS.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="DS.c1.s65"><qs/>'No, Sir, indeed.</s> <s sid="66" id="DS.c1.s66">I remember when Miss Florence was born--'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="DS.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="DS.c1.s67"><qs/>'Ay, ay, ay,'<qe/> said Mr Dombey, bending over the basket bedstead, and slightly bending his brows at the same time.</s> <s sid="68" id="DS.c1.s68"><qs/>'Miss Florence was all very well, but this is another matter.</s> <s sid="69" id="DS.c1.s69">This young gentleman has to accomplish a destiny.</s> <s sid="70" id="DS.c1.s70">A destiny, little fellow!'<qe/></s> <s sid="71" id="DS.c1.s71">As he thus apostrophised the infant he raised one of his hands to his lips, and kissed it; then, seeming to fear that the action involved some compromise of his dignity, went, awkwardly enough, away.</s> </p><p pid="24" id="DS.c1.p24"><s sid="72" id="DS.c1.s72">Doctor Parker Peps, one of the Court Physicians, and a man of immense reputation for assisting at the increase of great families, was walking up and down the drawing-room with his hands behind him, to the unspeakable admiration of the family Surgeon, who had regularly puffed the case for the last six weeks, among all his patients, friends, and acquaintances, as one to which he was in hourly expectation day and night of being summoned, in conjunction with Doctor Parker Pep.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="DS.c1.p25" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="DS.c1.s73"><qs/>'Well, Sir,'<qe/><sls/> said Doctor Parker Peps in a round, deep, sonorous voice, muffled for the occasion, like the knocker; <sle/><qs/>'do you find that your dear lady is at all roused by your visit?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="26" id="DS.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="DS.c1.s74"><qs/>'Stimulated as it were?'<qe/><sls/> said the family practitioner faintly: bowing at the same time to the Doctor, as much as to say, <sle/><qs/>'Excuse my putting in a word, but this is a valuable connexion.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="27" id="DS.c1.p27"><s sid="75" id="DS.c1.s75">Mr Dombey was quite discomfited by the question.</s> <s sid="76" id="DS.c1.s76">He had thought so little of the patient, that he was not in a condition to answer it.</s> <s sid="77" id="DS.c1.s77">He said that it would be a satisfaction to him, if Doctor Parker Peps would walk upstairs again.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="DS.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="DS.c1.s78"><qs/>'Good!</s> <s sid="79" id="DS.c1.s79">We must not disguise from you, Sir,'<qe/> said Doctor Parker Peps, 'that there is a want of power in Her Grace the Duchess--I beg your pardon; I confound names; I should say, in your amiable lady.</s> <s sid="80" id="DS.c1.s80">That there is a certain degree of languor, and a general absence of elasticity, which we would rather--not--</s> </p><p pid="29" id="DS.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="DS.c1.s81"><qs/>'See,'<qe/> interposed the family practitioner with another inclination of the head.</s> </p><p pid="30" id="DS.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="DS.c1.s82"><qs/>'Quite so,'<qe/><sss/> said Doctor Parker Peps,<sse/><qs/>' which we would rather not see.</s> <s sid="83" id="DS.c1.s83">It would appear that the system of Lady Cankaby--excuse me:</s> <s sid="84" id="DS.c1.s84">I should say of Mrs Dombey:</s> <s sid="85" id="DS.c1.s85">I confuse the names of cases--'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="31" id="DS.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="DS.c1.s86"><qs/>'So very numerous,'<qe/><sss/> murmured the family practitioner--<sse/><qs/>'can't be expected I'm sure--quite wonderful if otherwise--Doctor Parker Peps's West-End practice--'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="32" id="DS.c1.p32" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="DS.c1.s87"><qs/>'Thank you,'<qe/><sss/> said the Doctor, <sse/><qs/>'quite so.</s> <s sid="88" id="DS.c1.s88">It would appear, I was observing, that the system of our patient has sustained a shock, from which it can only hope to rally by a great and strong--'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="33" id="DS.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="DS.c1.s89"><qs/>'And vigorous,'<qe/> murmured the family practitioner.</s> </p><p pid="34" id="DS.c1.p34" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="DS.c1.s90"><qs/>'Quite so,'<qe/><sss/> assented the Doctor--<sse/><qs/>'and vigorous effort.</s> <s sid="91" id="DS.c1.s91">Mr Pilkins here, who from his position of medical adviser in this family--no one better qualified to fill that position, I am sure.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="35" id="DS.c1.p35" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="DS.c1.s92"><qs/>'Oh!'<qe/> murmured the family practitioner.</s> <s sid="93" id="DS.c1.s93"><qs/>'"Praise from Sir Hubert Stanley!"'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="36" id="DS.c1.p36" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="DS.c1.s94"><qs/>'You are good enough,'<qe/><sss/> returned Doctor Parker Peps, <sse/><qs/>'to say so.</s> <s sid="95" id="DS.c1.s95">Mr Pilkins who, from his position, is best acquainted with the patient's constitution in its normal state (an acquaintance very valuable to us in forming our opinions in these occasions), is of opinion, with me, that Nature must be called upon to make a vigorous effort in this instance; and that if our interesting friend the Countess of Dombey--I beg your pardon; Mrs Dombey--should not be--'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="37" id="DS.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="DS.c1.s96"><qs/>'Able,'<qe/> said the family practitioner.</s> </p><p pid="38" id="DS.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="DS.c1.s97"><qs/>'To make,'<qe/> said Doctor Parker Peps.</s> </p><p pid="39" id="DS.c1.p39" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="DS.c1.s98"><qs/>'That effort,'<qe/> said the family practitioner.</s> </p><p pid="40" id="DS.c1.p40" type="speech"><s sid="99" id="DS.c1.s99"><qs/>'Successfully,'<qe/> said they both together.</s> </p><p pid="41" id="DS.c1.p41" type="speech"><s sid="100" id="DS.c1.s100"><qs/>'Then,'<qe/> added Doctor Parker Peps, alone and very gravely, a crisis might arise, which we should both sincerely deplore.'</s> </p><p pid="42" id="DS.c1.p42"><s sid="101" id="DS.c1.s101">With that, they stood for a few seconds looking at the ground.</s> <s sid="102" id="DS.c1.s102">Then, on the motion--made in dumb show--of Doctor Parker Peps, they went upstairs; the family practitioner opening the room door for that distinguished professional, and following him out, with most obsequious politeness.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="DS.c1.p43"><s sid="103" id="DS.c1.s103">To record of Mr Dombey that he was not in his way affected by this intelligence, would be to do him an injustice.</s> <s sid="104" id="DS.c1.s104">He was not a man of whom it could properly be said that he was ever startled, or shocked; but he certainly had a sense within him, that if his wife should sicken and decay, he would be very sorry, and that he would find a something gone from among his plate and furniture, and other household possessions, which was well worth the having, and could not be lost without sincere regret.</s> <s sid="105" id="DS.c1.s105">Though it would be a cool, business-like, gentlemanly, self-possessed regret, no doubt.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="DS.c1.p44"><s sid="106" id="DS.c1.s106">His meditations on the subject were soon interrupted, first by the rustling of garments on the staircase, and then by the sudden whisking into the room of a lady rather past the middle age than otherwise but dressed in a very juvenile manner, particularly as to the tightness of her bodice, who, running up to him with a kind of screw in her face and carriage, expressive of suppressed emotion, flung her arms around his neck, and said, in a choking voice,</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 3. In which Mr Dombey, as a Man and a Father, is seen at the Head of the Home-Department</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c3.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c3.s1">The funeral of the deceased lady having been 'performed to the entire satisfaction of the undertaker, as well as of the neighbourhood at large, which is generally disposed to be captious on such a point, and is prone to take offence at any omissions or short-comings in the ceremonies, the various members of Mr Dombey's household subsided into their several places in the domestic system.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c3.s2">That small world, like the great one out of doors, had the capacity of easily forgetting its dead; and when the cook had said she was a quiet-tempered lady, and the house-keeper had said it was the common lot, and the butler had said who'd have thought it, and the housemaid had said she couldn't hardly believe it, and the footman had said it seemed exactly like a dream, they had quite worn the subject out, and began to think their mourning was wearing rusty too.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c3.p2"><s sid="3" id="DS.c3.s3">On Richards, who was established upstairs in a state of honourable captivity, the dawn of her new life seemed to break cold and grey.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c3.s4">Mr Dombey's house was a large one, on the shady side of a tall, dark, dreadfully genteel street in the region between Portland Place and Bryanstone Square.'</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c3.s5">It was a corner house, with great wide areas containing cellars frowned upon by barred windows, and leered at by crooked-eyed doors leading to dustbins.</s> <s sid="6" id="DS.c3.s6">It was a house of dismal state, with a circular back to it, containing a whole suite of drawing-rooms looking upon a gravelled yard, where two gaunt trees, with blackened trunks and branches, rattled rather than rustled, their leaves were so smoked-dried.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c3.s7">The summer sun was never on the street, but in the morning about breakfast-time, when it came with the water-carts and the old clothes men, and the people with geraniums, and the umbrella-mender, and the man who trilled the little bell of the Dutch clock as he went along.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c3.s8">It was soon gone again to return no more that day; and the bands of music and the straggling Punch's shows going after it, left it a prey to the most dismal of organs, and white mice; with now and then a porcupine, to vary the entertainments; until the butlers whose families were dining out, began to stand at the house-doors in the twilight, and the lamp-lighter made his nightly failure in attempting to brighten up the street with gas.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c3.p3"><s sid="9" id="DS.c3.s9">It was as blank a house inside as outside.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c3.s10">When the funeral was over, Mr Dombey ordered the furniture to be covered up--perhaps to preserve it for the son with whom his plans were all associated--and the rooms to be ungarnished, saving such as he retained for himself on the ground floor.</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c3.s11">Accordingly, mysterious shapes were made of tables and chairs, heaped together in the middle of rooms, and covered over with great winding-sheets.</s> <s sid="12" id="DS.c3.s12">Bell-handles, window-blinds, and looking-glasses, being papered up in journals, daily and weekly, obtruded fragmentary accounts of deaths and dreadful murders.</s> <s sid="13" id="DS.c3.s13">Every chandelier or lustre, muffled in holland, looked like a monstrous tear depending from the ceiling's eye.</s> <s sid="14" id="DS.c3.s14">Odours, as from vaults and damp places, came out of the chimneys.</s> <s sid="15" id="DS.c3.s15">The dead and buried lady was awful in a picture-frame of ghastly bandages.</s> <s sid="16" id="DS.c3.s16">Every gust of wind that rose, brought eddying round the corner from the neighbouring mews, some fragments of the straw that had been strewn before the house when she was ill, mildewed remains of which were still cleaving to the neighbourhood: and these, being always drawn by some invisible attraction to the threshold of the dirty house to let immediately opposite, addressed a dismal eloquence to Mr Dombey's windows.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c3.p4"><s sid="17" id="DS.c3.s17">The apartments which Mr Dombey reserved for his own inhabiting, were attainable from the hall, and consisted of a sitting-room; a library, which was in fact a dressing-room, so that the smell of hot-pressed paper, vellum, morocco, and Russia leather, contended in it with the smell of divers pairs of boots; and a kind of conservatory or little glass breakfast-room beyond, commanding a prospect of the trees before mentioned, and, generally speaking, of a few prowling cats.</s> <s sid="18" id="DS.c3.s18">These three rooms opened upon one another.</s> <s sid="19" id="DS.c3.s19">In the morning, when Mr Dombey was at his breakfast in one or other of the two first-mentioned of them, as well as in the afternoon when he came home to dinner, a bell was rung for Richards to repair to this glass chamber, and there walk to and fro with her young charge.</s> <s sid="20" id="DS.c3.s20">From the glimpses she caught of Mr Dombey at these times, sitting in the dark distance, looking out towards the infant from among the dark heavy furniture--the house had been inhabited for years by his father, and in many of its appointments was old-fashioned and grim--she began to entertain ideas of him in his solitary state, as if he were a lone prisoner in a cell, or a strange apparition that was not to be accosted or understood.</s> <s sid="21" id="DS.c3.s21">Mr Dombey came to be, in the course of a few days, invested in his own person, to her simple thinking, with all the mystery and gloom of his house.</s> <s sid="22" id="DS.c3.s22">As she walked up and down the glass room, or sat hushing the baby there--which she very often did for hours together, when the dusk was closing in, too--she would sometimes try to pierce the gloom beyond, and make out how he was looking and what he was doing.</s> <s sid="23" id="DS.c3.s23">Sensible that she was plainly to be seen by him' however, she never dared to pry in that direction but very furtively and for a moment at a time.</s> <s sid="24" id="DS.c3.s24">Consequently she made out nothing, and Mr Dombey in his den remained a very shade.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c3.p5"><s sid="25" id="DS.c3.s25">Little Paul Dombey's foster-mother had led this life herself, and had carried little Paul through it for some weeks; and had returned upstairs one day from a melancholy saunter through the dreary rooms of state (she never went out without Mrs Chick, who called on fine mornings, usually accompanied by Miss Tox, to take her and Baby for an airing--or in other words, to march them gravely up and down the pavement, like a walking funeral); when, as she was sitting in her own room, the door was slowly and quietly opened, and a dark-eyed little girl looked in.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 4. In which some more First Appearances are made on the Stage of these Adventures</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c4.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c4.s1">Though the offices of Dombey and Son were within the liberties of the City of London, and within hearing of Bow Bells, when their clashing voices were not drowned by the uproar in the streets, yet were there hints of adventurous and romantic story to be observed in some of the adjacent objects.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c4.s2">Gog and Magog held their state within ten minutes' walk; the Royal Exchange was close at hand; the Bank of England, with its vaults of gold and silver 'down among the dead men' underground, was their magnificent neighbour.</s> <s sid="3" id="DS.c4.s3">Just round the corner stood the rich East India House, teeming with suggestions of precious stuffs and stones, tigers, elephants, howdahs, hookahs, umbrellas, palm trees, palanquins, and gorgeous princes of a brown complexion sitting on carpets, with their slippers very much turned up at the toes.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c4.s4">Anywhere in the immediate vicinity there might be seen pictures of ships speeding away full sail to all parts of the world; outfitting warehouses ready to pack off anybody anywhere, fully equipped in half an hour; and little timber midshipmen in obsolete naval uniforms, eternally employed outside the shop doors of nautical Instrument-makers in taking observations of the hackney carriages.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c4.p2"><s sid="5" id="DS.c4.s5">Sole master and proprietor of one of these effigies--of that which might be called, familiarly, the woodenest--of that which thrust itself out above the pavement, right leg foremost, with a suavity the least endurable, and had the shoe buckles and flapped waistcoat the least reconcileable to human reason, and bore at its right eye the most offensively disproportionate piece of machinery--sole master and proprietor of that Midshipman, and proud of him too, an elderly gentleman in a Welsh wig had paid house-rent, taxes, rates, and dues, for more years than many a full-grown midshipman of flesh and blood has numbered in his life; and midshipmen who have attained a pretty green old age, have not been wanting in the English Navy.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c4.p3"><s sid="6" id="DS.c4.s6">The stock-in-trade of this old gentleman comprised chronometers, barometers, telescopes, compasses, charts, maps, sextants, quadrants, and specimens of every kind of instrument used in the working of a ship's course, or the keeping of a ship's reckoning, or the prosecuting of a ship's discoveries.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c4.s7">Objects in brass and glass were in his drawers and on his shelves, which none but the initiated could have found the top of, or guessed the use of, or having once examined, could have ever got back again into their mahogany nests without assistance.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c4.s8">Everything was jammed into the tightest cases, fitted into the narrowest corners, fenced up behind the most impertinent cushions, and screwed into the acutest angles, to prevent its philosophical composure from being disturbed by the rolling of the sea.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c4.s9">Such extraordinary precautions were taken in every instance to save room, and keep the thing compact; and so much practical navigation was fitted, and cushioned, and screwed into every box (whether the box was a mere slab, as some were, or something between a cocked hat and a star-fish, as others were, and those quite mild and modest boxes as compared with others); that the shop itself, partaking of the general infection, seemed almost to become a snug, sea-going, ship-shape concern, wanting only good sea-room, in the event of an unexpected launch, to work its way securely to any desert island in the world.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c4.p4"><s sid="10" id="DS.c4.s10">Many minor incidents in the household life of the Ships'</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c4.p5"><s sid="11" id="DS.c4.s11">Instrument-maker who was proud of his little Midshipman, assisted and bore out this fancy.</s> <s sid="12" id="DS.c4.s12">His acquaintance lying chiefly among ship-chandlers and so forth, he had always plenty of the veritable ships' biscuit on his table.</s> <s sid="13" id="DS.c4.s13">It was familiar with dried meats and tongues, possessing an extraordinary flavour of rope yarn.</s> <s sid="14" id="DS.c4.s14">Pickles were produced upon it, in great wholesale jars, with 'dealer in all kinds of Ships' Provisions' on the label; spirits were set forth in case bottles with no throats.</s> <s sid="15" id="DS.c4.s15">Old prints of ships with alphabetical references to their various mysteries, hung in frames upon the walls; the Tartar Frigate under weigh, was on the plates; outlandish shells, seaweeds, and mosses, decorated the chimney-piece; the little wainscotted back parlour was lighted by a sky-light, like a cabin.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DS.c4.p6"><s sid="16" id="DS.c4.s16">Here he lived too, in skipper-like state, all alone with his nephew Walter: a boy of fourteen who looked quite enough like a midshipman, to carry out the prevailing idea.</s> <s sid="17" id="DS.c4.s17">But there it ended, for Solomon Gills himself (more generally called old Sol) was far from having a maritime appearance.</s> <s sid="18" id="DS.c4.s18">To say nothing of his Welsh wig, which was as plain and stubborn a Welsh wig as ever was worn, and in which he looked like anything but a Rover, he was a slow, quiet-spoken, thoughtful old fellow, with eyes as red as if they had been small suns looking at you through a fog; and a newly-awakened manner, such as he might have acquired by having stared for three or four days successively through every optical instrument in his shop, and suddenly came back to the world again, to find it green.</s> <s sid="19" id="DS.c4.s19">The only change ever known in his outward man, was from a complete suit of coffee-colour cut very square, and ornamented with glaring buttons, to the same suit of coffee-colour minus the inexpressibles, which were then of a pale nankeen.</s> <s sid="20" id="DS.c4.s20">He wore a very precise shirt-frill, and carried a pair of first-rate spectacles on his forehead, and a tremendous chronometer in his fob, rather than doubt which precious possession, he would have believed in a conspiracy against it on part of all the clocks and watches in the City, and even of the very Sun itself.</s> <s sid="21" id="DS.c4.s21">Such as he was, such he had been in the shop and parlour behind the little Midshipman, for years upon years; going regularly aloft to bed every night in a howling garret remote from the lodgers, where, when gentlemen of England who lived below at ease had little or no idea of the state of the weather, it often blew great guns.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 7. A Bird's-eye Glimpse of Miss Tox's Dwelling-place: also of the State of Miss Tox's Affections</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c7.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c7.s1">Miss Tox inhabited a dark little house that had been squeezed, at some remote period of English History, into a fashionable neighbourhood at the west end of the town, where it stood in the shade like a poor relation of the great street round the corner, coldly looked down upon by mighty mansions.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c7.s2">It was not exactly in a court, and it was not exactly in a yard; but it was in the dullest of No-Thoroughfares, rendered anxious and haggard by distant double knocks.</s> <s sid="3" id="DS.c7.s3">The name of this retirement, where grass grew between the chinks in the stone pavement, was Princess's Place; and in Princess's Place was Princess's Chapel, with a tinkling bell, where sometimes as many as five-and-twenty people attended service on a Sunday.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c7.s4">The Princess's Arms was also there, and much resorted to by splendid footmen.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c7.s5">A sedan chair was kept inside the railing before the Princess's Arms, but it had never come out within the memory of man; and on fine mornings, the top of every rail (there were eight-and-forty, as Miss Tox had often counted) was decorated with a pewter-pot.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c7.p2"><s sid="6" id="DS.c7.s6">There was another private house besides Miss Tox's in Princess's Place: not to mention an immense Pair of gates, with an immense pair of lion-headed knockers on them, which were never opened by any chance, and were supposed to constitute a disused entrance to somebody's stables.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c7.s7">Indeed, there was a smack of stabling in the air of Princess's Place; and Miss Tox's bedroom (which was at the back) commanded a vista of Mews, where hostlers, at whatever sort of work engaged, were continually accompanying themselves with effervescent noises; and where the most domestic and confidential garments of coachmen and their wives and families, usually hung, like Macbeth's banners, on the outward walls.'</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c7.p3" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="DS.c7.s8">At this other private house in Princess's Place, tenanted by a retired butler who had married a housekeeper, apartments were let Furnished, to a single gentleman: to wit, a wooden-featured, blue-faced Major, with his eyes starting out of his head, in whom Miss Tox recognised, as she herself expressed it, <qs/>'something so truly military;'<qe/><sls/> and between whom and herself, an occasional interchange of newspapers and pamphlets, and such Platonic dalliance, was effected through the medium of a dark servant of the Major's who Miss Tox was quite content to classify as a <sle/><qs/>'native,'<qe/> without connecting him with any geographical idea whatever.</s> </p><p pid="4" id="DS.c7.p4"><s sid="9" id="DS.c7.s9">Perhaps there never was a smaller entry and staircase, than the entry and staircase of Miss Tox's house.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c7.s10">Perhaps, taken altogether, from top to bottom, it was the most inconvenient little house in England, and the crookedest; but then, Miss Tox said, what a situation!</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c7.s11">There was very little daylight to be got there in the winter: no sun at the best of times: air was out of the question, and traffic was walled out.</s> <s sid="12" id="DS.c7.s12">Still Miss Tox said, think of the situation!</s> <s sid="13" id="DS.c7.s13">So said the blue-faced Major, whose eyes were starting out of his head: who gloried in Princess's Place: and who delighted to turn the conversation at his club, whenever he could, to something connected with some of the great people in the great street round the corner, that he might have the satisfaction of saying they were his neighbours.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c7.p5"><s sid="14" id="DS.c7.s14">In short, with Miss Tox and the blue-faced Major, it was enough for Princess's Place--as with a very small fragment of society, it is enough for many a little hanger-on of another sort--to be well connected, and to have genteel blood in its veins.</s> <s sid="15" id="DS.c7.s15">It might be poor, mean, shabby, stupid, dull.</s> <s sid="16" id="DS.c7.s16">No matter.</s> <s sid="17" id="DS.c7.s17">The great street round the corner trailed off into Princess's Place; and that which of High Holborn would have become a choleric word, spoken of Princess's Place became flat blasphemy.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DS.c7.p6"><s sid="18" id="DS.c7.s18">The dingy tenement inhabited by Miss Tox was her own; having been devised and bequeathed to her by the deceased owner of the fishy eye in the locket, of whom a miniature portrait, with a powdered head and a pigtail, balanced the kettle-holder on opposite sides of the parlour fireplace.</s> <s sid="19" id="DS.c7.s19">The greater part of the furniture was of the powdered-head and pig-tail period: comprising a plate-warmer, always languishing and sprawling its four attenuated bow legs in somebody's way; and an obsolete harpsichord, illuminated round the maker's name with a painted garland of sweet peas.</s> <s sid="20" id="DS.c7.s20">In any part of the house, visitors were usually cognizant of a prevailing mustiness; and in warm weather Miss Tox had been seen apparently writing in sundry chinks and crevices of the wainscoat with the the wrong end of a pen dipped in spirits of turpentine.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DS.c7.p7"><s sid="21" id="DS.c7.s21">Although Major Bagstock had arrived at what is called in polite literature, the grand meridian of life, and was proceeding on his journey downhill with hardly any throat, and a very rigid pair of jaw-bones, and long-flapped elephantine ears, and his eyes and complexion in the state of artificial excitement already mentioned, he was mightily proud of awakening an interest in Miss Tox, and tickled his vanity with the fiction that she was a splendid woman who had her eye on him.</s> <s sid="22" id="DS.c7.s22">This he had several times hinted at the club: in connexion with little jocularities, of which old Joe Bagstock, old Joey Bagstock, old J. Bagstock, old Josh Bagstock, or so forth, was the perpetual theme: it being, as it were, the Major's stronghold and donjon-keep of light humour, to be on the most familiar terms with his own name.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="DS.c7.p8" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="DS.c7.s23"><qs/>'Joey B., Sir,'<qe/><sls/>the Major would say, with a flourish of his walking-stick, <sle/><qs/>'is worth a dozen of you.</s> <s sid="24" id="DS.c7.s24">If you had a few more of the Bagstock breed among you, Sir, you'd be none the worse for it.</s> <s sid="25" id="DS.c7.s25">Old Joe, Sir, needn't look far for a wile even now, if he was on the look-out; but he's hard-hearted, Sir, is Joe--he's tough, Sir, tough, and de-vilish sly!'<qe/></s> <s sid="26" id="DS.c7.s26">After such a declaration, wheezing sounds would be heard; and the Major's blue would deepen into purple, while his eyes strained and started convulsively.</s> </p><p pid="9" id="DS.c7.p9"><s sid="27" id="DS.c7.s27">Notwithstanding his very liberal laudation of himself, however, the Major was selfish.</s> <s sid="28" id="DS.c7.s28">It may be doubted whether there ever was a more entirely selfish person at heart; or at stomach is perhaps a better expression, seeing that he was more decidedly endowed with that latter organ than with the former.</s> <s sid="29" id="DS.c7.s29">He had no idea of being overlooked or slighted by anybody; least of all, had he the remotest comprehension of being overlooked and slighted by Miss Tox.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="DS.c7.p10"><s sid="30" id="DS.c7.s30">And yet, Miss Tox, as it appeared, forgot him--gradually forgot him.</s> <s sid="31" id="DS.c7.s31">She began to forget him soon after her discovery of the Toodle family.</s> <s sid="32" id="DS.c7.s32">She continued to forget him up to the time of the christening.</s> <s sid="33" id="DS.c7.s33">She went on forgetting him with compound interest after that.</s> <s sid="34" id="DS.c7.s34">Something or somebody had superseded him as a source of interest.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="DS.c7.p11" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="DS.c7.s35"><qs/>'Good morning, Ma'am,'<qe/> said the Major, meeting Miss Tox in Princess's Place, some weeks after the changes chronicled in the last chapter.</s> </p><p pid="12" id="DS.c7.p12" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="DS.c7.s36"><qs/>'Good morning, Sir,'<qe/> said Miss Tox; very coldly.</s> </p><p pid="13" id="DS.c7.p13" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="DS.c7.s37"><qs/>'Joe Bagstock, Ma'am,'<qe/><sls/> observed the Major, with his usual gallantry, <sle/><qs/>'has not had the happiness of bowing to you at your window, for a considerable period.</s> <s sid="38" id="DS.c7.s38">Joe has been hardly used, Ma'am.</s> <s sid="39" id="DS.c7.s39">His sun has been behind a cloud.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="DS.c7.p14"><s sid="40" id="DS.c7.s40">Miss Tox inclined her head; but very coldly indeed.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="DS.c7.p18" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="DS.c7.s48"><qs/>'Why, damme, Sir,'<qe/><sls/> said the Major, rolling his lobster eyes round and round Princess's Place, and apostrophizing its fragrant air, <sle/><qs/>'six months ago, the woman loved the ground Josh Bagstock walked on.</s> <s sid="49" id="DS.c7.s49">What's the meaning of it?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="DS.c7.p19" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="DS.c7.s50">The Major decided, after some consideration, that it meant mantraps; that it meant plotting and snaring; that Miss Tox was digging pitfalls.</s> <s sid="51" id="DS.c7.s51"><qs/>'But you won't catch Joe, Ma'am,'<qe/> said the Major.</s> <s sid="52" id="DS.c7.s52"><qs/>'He's tough, Ma'am, tough, is J.B. Tough, and de-vilish sly!'<qe/> over which reflection he chuckled for the rest of the day.</s> </p><p pid="20" id="DS.c7.p20"><s sid="53" id="DS.c7.s53">But still, when that day and many other days were gone and past, it seemed that Miss Tox took no heed whatever of the Major, and thought nothing at all about him.</s> <s sid="54" id="DS.c7.s54">She had been wont, once upon a time, to look out at one of her little dark windows by accident, and blushingly return the Major's greeting; but now, she never gave the Major a chance, and cared nothing at all whether he looked over the way or not.</s> <s sid="55" id="DS.c7.s55">Other changes had come to pass too.</s> <s sid="56" id="DS.c7.s56">The Major, standing in the shade of his own apartment, could make out that an air of greater smartness had recently come over Miss Tox's house; that a new cage with gilded wires had been provided for the ancient little canary bird; that divers ornaments, cut out of coloured card-boards and paper, seemed to decorate the chimney-piece and tables; that a plant or two had suddenly sprung up in the windows; that Miss Tox occasionally practised on the harpsichord, whose garland of sweet peas was always displayed ostentatiously, crowned with the Copenhagen and Bird Waltzes in a Music Book of Miss Tox's own copying.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="DS.c7.p21"><s sid="57" id="DS.c7.s57">Over and above all this, Miss Tox had long been dressed with uncommon care and elegance in slight mourning.</s> <s sid="58" id="DS.c7.s58">But this helped the Major out of his difficulty; and be determined within himself that she had come into a small legacy, and grown proud.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="DS.c7.p22"><s sid="59" id="DS.c7.s59">It was on the very next day after he had eased his mind by arriving at this decision, that the Major, sitting at his breakfast, saw an apparition so tremendous and wonderful in Miss Tox's little drawing-room, that he remained for some time rooted to his chair; then, rushing into the next room, returned with a double-barrelled opera-glass, through which he surveyed it intently for some minutes.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="DS.c7.p23" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="DS.c7.s60"><qs/>'It's a Baby, Sir,'<qe/><sls/> said the Major, shutting up the glass again, <sle/><qs/>'for fifty thousand pounds!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="24" id="DS.c7.p24"><s sid="61" id="DS.c7.s61">The Major couldn't forget it.</s> <s sid="62" id="DS.c7.s62">He could do nothing but whistle, and stare to that extent, that his eyes, compared with what they now became, had been in former times quite cavernous and sunken.</s> <s sid="63" id="DS.c7.s63">Day after day, two, three, four times a week, this Baby reappeared.</s> <s sid="64" id="DS.c7.s64">The Major continued to stare and whistle.</s> <s sid="65" id="DS.c7.s65">To all other intents and purposes he was alone in Princess's Place.</s> <s sid="66" id="DS.c7.s66">Miss Tox had ceased to mind what he did.</s> <s sid="67" id="DS.c7.s67">He might have been black as well as blue, and it would have been of no consequence to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="DS.c7.p25"><s sid="68" id="DS.c7.s68">The perseverance with which she walked out of Princess's Place to fetch this baby and its nurse, and walked back with them, and walked home with them again, and continually mounted guard over them; and the perseverance with which she nursed it herself, and fed it, and played with it, and froze its young blood with airs upon the harpsichord, was extraordinary.</s> <s sid="69" id="DS.c7.s69">At about this same period too, she was seized with a passion for looking at a certain bracelet; also with a passion for looking at the moon, of which she would take long observations from her chamber window.</s> <s sid="70" id="DS.c7.s70">But whatever she looked at; sun, moon, stars, or bracelet; she looked no more at the Major.</s> <s sid="71" id="DS.c7.s71">And the Major whistled, and stared, and wondered, and dodged about his room, and could make nothing of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="DS.c7.p26" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="DS.c7.s72"><qs/>'You'll quite win my brother Paul's heart, and that's the truth, my dear,'<qe/> said Mrs Chick, one day.</s> </p><p pid="27" id="DS.c7.p27"><s sid="73" id="DS.c7.s73">Miss Tox turned pale.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c8.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c8.s1">Beneath the watching and attentive eyes of Time--so far another Major--Paul's slumbers gradually changed.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c8.s2">More and more light broke in upon them; distincter and distincter dreams disturbed them; an accumulating crowd of objects and impressions swarmed about his rest; and so he passed from babyhood to childhood, and became a talking, walking, wondering Dombey.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c8.p2"><s sid="3" id="DS.c8.s3">On the downfall and banishment of Richards, the nursery may be said to have been put into commission: as a Public Department is sometimes, when no individual Atlas can be found to support it The Commissioners were, of course, Mrs Chick and Miss Tox: who devoted themselves to their duties with such astonishing ardour that Major Bagstock had every day some new reminder of his being forsaken, while Mr Chick, bereft of domestic supervision, cast himself upon the gay world, dined at clubs and coffee-houses, smelt of smoke on three different occasions, went to the play by himself, and in short, loosened (as Mrs Chick once told him) every social bond, and moral obligation.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c8.p3"><s sid="4" id="DS.c8.s4">Yet, in spite of his early promise, all this vigilance and care could not make little Paul a thriving boy.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c8.s5">Naturally delicate, perhaps, he pined and wasted after the dismissal of his nurse, and, for a long time, seemed but to wait his opportunity of gliding through their hands, and seeking his lost mother.</s> <s sid="6" id="DS.c8.s6">This dangerous ground in his steeple-chase towards manhood passed, he still found it very rough riding, and was grievously beset by all the obstacles in his course.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c8.s7">Every tooth was a break-neck fence, and every pimple in the measles a stone wall to him.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c8.s8">He was down in every fit of the hooping-cough, and rolled upon and crushed by a whole field of small diseases, that came trooping on each other's heels to prevent his getting up again.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c8.s9">Some bird of prey got into his throat instead of the thrush; and the very chickens turning ferocious--if they have anything to do with that infant malady to which they lend their name--worried him like tiger-cats.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c8.p4"><s sid="10" id="DS.c8.s10">The chill of Paul's christening had struck home, perhaps to some sensitive part of his nature, which could not recover itself in the cold shade of his father; but he was an unfortunate child from that day.</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c8.s11">Mrs Wickam often said she never see a dear so put upon.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c8.p5"><s sid="12" id="DS.c8.s12">Mrs Wickam was a waiter's wife--which would seem equivalent to being any other man's widow--whose application for an engagement in Mr Dombey's service had been favourably considered, on account of the apparent impossibility of her having any followers, or anyone to follow; and who, from within a day or two of Paul's sharp weaning, had been engaged as his nurse.</s> <s sid="13" id="DS.c8.s13">Mrs Wickam was a meek woman, of a fair complexion, with her eyebrows always elevated, and her head always drooping; who was always ready to pity herself, or to be pitied, or to pity anybody else; and who had a surprising natural gift of viewing all subjects in an utterly forlorn and pitiable light, and bringing dreadful precedents to bear upon them, and deriving the greatest consolation from the exercise of that talent.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DS.c8.p6"><s sid="14" id="DS.c8.s14">It is hardly necessary to observe, that no touch of this quality ever reached the magnificent knowledge of Mr Dombey.</s> <s sid="15" id="DS.c8.s15">It would have been remarkable, indeed, if any had; when no one in the house--not even Mrs Chick or Miss Tox--dared ever whisper to him that there had, on any one occasion, been the least reason for uneasiness in reference to little Paul.</s> <s sid="16" id="DS.c8.s16">He had settled, within himself, that the child must necessarily pass through a certain routine of minor maladies, and that the sooner he did so the better.</s> <s sid="17" id="DS.c8.s17">If he could have bought him off, or provided a substitute, as in the case of an unlucky drawing for the militia, he would have been glad to do so, on liberal terms.</s> <s sid="18" id="DS.c8.s18">But as this was not feasible, he merely wondered, in his haughty-manner, now and then, what Nature meant by it; and comforted himself with the reflection that there was another milestone passed upon the road, and that the great end of the journey lay so much the nearer.</s> <s sid="19" id="DS.c8.s19">For the feeling uppermost in his mind, now and constantly intensifying, and increasing in it as Paul grew older, was impatience.</s> <s sid="20" id="DS.c8.s20">Impatience for the time to come, when his visions of their united consequence and grandeur would be triumphantly realized.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DS.c8.p7"><s sid="21" id="DS.c8.s21">Some philosophers tell us that selfishness is at the root of our best loves and affections.'</s> <s sid="22" id="DS.c8.s22">Mr Dombey's young child was, from the beginning, so distinctly important to him as a part of his own greatness, or (which is the same thing) of the greatness of Dombey and Son, that there is no doubt his parental affection might have been easily traced, like many a goodly superstructure of fair fame, to a very low foundation.</s> <s sid="23" id="DS.c8.s23">But he loved his son with all the love he had.</s> <s sid="24" id="DS.c8.s24">If there were a warm place in his frosty heart, his son occupied it; if its very hard surface could receive the impression of any image, the image of that son was there; though not so much as an infant, or as a boy, but as a grown man--the 'Son' of the Firm.</s> <s sid="25" id="DS.c8.s25">Therefore he was impatient to advance into the future, and to hurry over the intervening passages of his history.</s> <s sid="26" id="DS.c8.s26">Therefore he had little or no anxiety' about them, in spite of his love; feeling as if the boy had a charmed life, and must become the man with whom he held such constant communication in his thoughts, and for whom he planned and projected, as for an existing reality, every day.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="DS.c8.p8"><s sid="27" id="DS.c8.s27">Thus Paul grew to be nearly five years old.</s> <s sid="28" id="DS.c8.s28">He was a pretty little fellow; though there was something wan and wistful in his small face, that gave occasion to many significant shakes of Mrs Wickam's head, and many long-drawn inspirations of Mrs Wickam's breath.</s> <s sid="29" id="DS.c8.s29">His temper gave abundant promise of being imperious in after-life; and he had as hopeful an apprehension of his own importance, and the rightful subservience of all other things and persons to it, as heart could desire.</s> <s sid="30" id="DS.c8.s30">He was childish and sportive enough at times, and not of a sullen disposition; but he had a strange, old-fashioned, thoughtful way, at other times, of sitting brooding in his miniature arm-chair, when he looked (and talked) like one of those terrible little Beings in the Fairy tales, who, at a hundred and fifty or two hundred years of age, fantastically represent the children for whom they have been substituted.</s> <s sid="31" id="DS.c8.s31">He would frequently be stricken with this precocious mood upstairs in the nursery; and would sometimes lapse into it suddenly, exclaiming that he was tired: even while playing with Florence, or driving Miss Tox in single harness.</s> <s sid="32" id="DS.c8.s32">But at no time did he fall into it so surely, as when, his little chair being carried down into his father's room, he sat there with him after dinner, by the fire.</s> <s sid="33" id="DS.c8.s33">They were the strangest pair at such a time that ever firelight shone upon.</s> <s sid="34" id="DS.c8.s34">Mr Dombey so erect and solemn, gazing at the blare; his little image, with an old, old face, peering into the red perspective with the fixed and rapt attention of a sage.</s> <s sid="35" id="DS.c8.s35">Mr Dombey entertaining complicated worldly schemes and plans; the little image entertaining Heaven knows what wild fancies, half-formed thoughts, and wandering speculations.</s> <s sid="36" id="DS.c8.s36">Mr Dombey stiff with starch and arrogance; the little image by inheritance, and in unconscious imitation.</s> <s sid="37" id="DS.c8.s37">The two so very much alike, and yet so monstrously contrasted.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="DS.c8.p9"><s sid="38" id="DS.c8.s38">On one of these occasions, when they had both been perfectly quiet for a long time, and Mr Dombey only knew that the child was awake by occasionally glancing at his eye, where the bright fire was sparkling like a jewel, little Paul broke silence thus:</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="DS.c8.p10" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="DS.c8.s39"><qs/>'Papa! what's money?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="DS.c8.p11"><s sid="40" id="DS.c8.s40">The abrupt question had such immediate reference to the subject of Mr Dombey's thoughts, that Mr Dombey was quite disconcerted.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="DS.c8.p12" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="DS.c8.s41"><qs/>'What is money, Paul?'<qe/> he answered.</s> <s sid="42" id="DS.c8.s42"><qs/>'Money?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="DS.c8.p13" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="DS.c8.s43"><qs/>'Yes,'<qe/><sls/> said the child, laying his hands upon the elbows of his little chair, and turning the old face up towards Mr Dombey's; <sle/><qs/>'what is money?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="DS.c8.p14" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="DS.c8.s44">Mr Dombey was in a difficulty.</s> <s sid="45" id="DS.c8.s45">He would have liked to give him some explanation involving the terms circulating-medium, currency, depreciation of currency', paper, bullion, rates of exchange, value of precious metals in the market, and so forth; but looking down at the little chair, and seeing what a long way down it was, he answered:</s> <s sid="46" id="DS.c8.s46"><qs/>'Gold, and silver, and copper.</s> <s sid="47" id="DS.c8.s47">Guineas, shillings, half-pence.</s> <s sid="48" id="DS.c8.s48">You know what they are?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="DS.c8.p15" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="DS.c8.s49"><qs/>'Oh yes, I know what they are,'<qe/> said Paul.</s> <s sid="50" id="DS.c8.s50"><qs/>'I don't mean that, Papa.</s> <s sid="51" id="DS.c8.s51">I mean what's money after all?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="16" id="DS.c8.p16"><s sid="52" id="DS.c8.s52">Heaven and Earth, how old his face was as he turned it up again towards his father's!</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="DS.c8.p17" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="DS.c8.s53"><qs/>'What is money after all!'<qe/> said Mr Dombey, backing his chair a little, that he might the better gaze in sheer amazement at the presumptuous atom that propounded such an inquiry.</s> </p><p pid="18" id="DS.c8.p18" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="DS.c8.s54"><qs/>'I mean, Papa, what can it do?'<qe/> returned Paul, folding his arms (they were hardly long enough to fold), and looking at the fire, and up at him, and at the fire, and up at him again.</s> </p><p pid="19" id="DS.c8.p19" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="DS.c8.s55">Mr Dombey drew his chair back to its former place, and patted him on the head.</s> <s sid="56" id="DS.c8.s56"><qs/>'You'll know better by-and-by, my man,'<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="57" id="DS.c8.s57"><qs/>'Money, Paul, can do anything.'<qe/></s> <s sid="58" id="DS.c8.s58">He took hold of the little hand, and beat it softly against one of his own, as he said so.</s> </p><p pid="20" id="DS.c8.p20"><s sid="59" id="DS.c8.s59">But Paul got his hand free as soon as he could; and rubbing it gently to and fro on the elbow of his chair, as if his wit were in the palm, and he were sharpening it--and looking at the fire again, as though the fire had been his adviser and prompter--repeated, after a short pause:</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="DS.c8.p21" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="DS.c8.s60"><qs/>'Anything, Papa?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="22" id="DS.c8.p22" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="DS.c8.s61"><qs/>'Yes.</s> <s sid="62" id="DS.c8.s62">Anything--almost,'<qe/> said Mr Dombey.</s> </p><p pid="23" id="DS.c8.p23" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="DS.c8.s63"><qs/>'Anything means everything, don't it, Papa?'<qe/> asked his son: not observing, or possibly not understanding, the qualification.</s> </p><p pid="24" id="DS.c8.p24" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="DS.c8.s64"><qs/>'It includes it: yes,'<qe/> said Mr Dombey.</s> </p><p pid="25" id="DS.c8.p25" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="DS.c8.s65"><qs/>'Why didn't money save me my Mama?'<qe/> returned the child.</s> <s sid="66" id="DS.c8.s66"><qs/>'It isn't cruel, is it?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="26" id="DS.c8.p26" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="DS.c8.s67"><qs/>'Cruel!'<qe/> said Mr Dombey, settling his neckcloth, and seeming to resent the idea.</s> <s sid="68" id="DS.c8.s68"><qs/>'No. A good thing can't be cruel.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="27" id="DS.c8.p27" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="DS.c8.s69"><qs/>'If it's a good thing, and can do anything,'<qe/><sls/> said the little fellow, thoughtfully, as he looked back at the fire, <sle/><qs/>'I wonder why it didn't save me my Mama.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="28" id="DS.c8.p28"><s sid="70" id="DS.c8.s70">He didn't ask the question of his father this time.</s> <s sid="71" id="DS.c8.s71">Perhaps he had seen, with a child's quickness, that it had already made his father uncomfortable.</s> <s sid="72" id="DS.c8.s72">But he repeated the thought aloud, as if it were quite an old one to him, and had troubled him very much; and sat with his chin resting on his hand, still cogitating and looking for an explanation in the fire.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="DS.c8.p29"><s sid="73" id="DS.c8.s73">Mr Dombey having recovered from his surprise, not to say his alarm (for it was the very first occasion on which the child had ever broached the subject of his mother to him, though he had had him sitting by his side, in this same manner, evening after evening), expounded to him how that money, though a very potent spirit, never to be disparaged on any account whatever, could not keep people alive whose time was come to die; and how that we must all die, unfortunately, even in the City, though we were never so rich.</s> <s sid="74" id="DS.c8.s74">But how that money caused us to be honoured, feared, respected, courted, and admired, and made us powerful and glorious in the eyes of all men; and how that it could, very often, even keep off death, for a long time together.</s> <s sid="75" id="DS.c8.s75">How, for example, it had secured to his Mama the services of Mr Pilkins, by which be, Paul, had often profited himself; likewise of the great Doctor Parker Peps, whom he had never known.</s> <s sid="76" id="DS.c8.s76">And how it could do all, that could be done.</s> <s sid="77" id="DS.c8.s77">This, with more to the same purpose, Mr Dombey instilled into the mind of his son, who listened attentively, and seemed to understand the greater part of what was said to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="DS.c8.p30" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="DS.c8.s78"><qs/>'It can't make me strong and quite well, either, Papa; can it?'<qe/> asked Paul, after a short silence; rubbing his tiny hands.</s> </p><p pid="31" id="DS.c8.p31" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="DS.c8.s79"><qs/>'Why, you are strong and quite well,'<qe/> returned Mr Dombey.</s> <s sid="80" id="DS.c8.s80"><qs/>'Are you not?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="32" id="DS.c8.p32"><s sid="81" id="DS.c8.s81">Oh! the age of the face that was turned up again, with an expression, half of melancholy, half of slyness, on it!</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="DS.c8.p33" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="DS.c8.s82"><qs/>'You are as strong and well as such little people usually are?</s> <s sid="83" id="DS.c8.s83">Eh?'<qe/> said Mr Dombey.</s> </p><p pid="34" id="DS.c8.p34" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="DS.c8.s84">'Florence is older than I am, but I'm not as strong and well as Florence, <qs/>'I know,'<qe/><sss/> returned the child; <sse/><qs/>'and I believe that when Florence was as little as me, she could play a great deal longer at a time without tiring herself.</s> <s sid="85" id="DS.c8.s85">I am so tired sometimes,'<qe/><sls/> said little Paul, warming his hands, and looking in between the bars of the grate, as if some ghostly puppet-show were performing there, <sle/><qs/>'and my bones ache so (Wickam says it's my bones), that I don't know what to do.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="35" id="DS.c8.p35" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="DS.c8.s86"><qs/>'Ay!</s> <s sid="87" id="DS.c8.s87">But that's at night,'<qe/><sls/> said Mr Dombey, drawing his own chair closer to his son's, and laying his hand gently on his back; <sle/><qs/>'little people should be tired at night, for then they sleep well.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="36" id="DS.c8.p36" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="DS.c8.s88"><qs/>'Oh, it's not at night, Papa,'<qe/><sss/> returned the child, <sse/><qs/>'it's in the day; and I lie down in Florence's lap, and she sings to me.</s> <s sid="89" id="DS.c8.s89">At night I dream about such cu-ri-ous things!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="37" id="DS.c8.p37"><s sid="90" id="DS.c8.s90">And he went on, warming his hands again, and thinking about them, like an old man or a young goblin.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="DS.c8.p38"><s sid="91" id="DS.c8.s91">Mr Dombey was so astonished, and so uncomfortable, and so perfectly at a loss how to pursue the conversation, that he could only sit looking at his son by the light of the fire, with his hand resting on his back, as if it were detained there by some magnetic attraction.</s> <s sid="92" id="DS.c8.s92">Once he advanced his other hand, and turned the contemplative face towards his own for a moment.</s> <s sid="93" id="DS.c8.s93">But it sought the fire again as soon as he released it; and remained, addressed towards the flickering blaze, until the nurse appeared, to summon him to bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="DS.c8.p39" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="DS.c8.s94"><qs/>'I want Florence to come for me,'<qe/> said Paul.</s> </p><p pid="40" id="DS.c8.p40" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="DS.c8.s95"><qs/>'Won't you come with your poor Nurse Wickam, Master Paul?'<qe/> inquired that attendant, with great pathos.</s> </p><p pid="41" id="DS.c8.p41" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="DS.c8.s96"><qs/>'No, I won't,'<qe/> replied Paul, composing himself in his arm-chair again, like the master of the house.</s> </p><p pid="42" id="DS.c8.p42"><s sid="97" id="DS.c8.s97">Invoking a blessing upon his innocence, Mrs Wickam withdrew, and presently Florence appeared in her stead.</s> <s sid="98" id="DS.c8.s98">The child immediately started up with sudden readiness and animation, and raised towards his father in bidding him good-night, a countenance so much brighter, so much younger, and so much more child-like altogether, that Mr Dombey, while he felt greatly reassured by the change, was quite amazed at it.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="DS.c8.p43"><s sid="99" id="DS.c8.s99">After they had left the room together, he thought he heard a soft voice singing; and remembering that Paul had said his sister sung to him, he had the curiosity to open the door and listen, and look after them.</s> <s sid="100" id="DS.c8.s100">She was toiling up the great, wide, vacant staircase, with him in her arms; his head was lying on her shoulder, one of his arms thrown negligently round her neck.</s> <s sid="101" id="DS.c8.s101">So they went, toiling up; she singing all the way, and Paul sometimes crooning out a feeble accompaniment.</s> <s sid="102" id="DS.c8.s102">Mr Dombey looked after them until they reached the top of the staircase--not without halting to rest by the way--and passed out of his sight; and then he still stood gazing upwards, until the dull rays of the moon, glimmering in a melancholy manner through the dim skylight, sent him back to his room.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="DS.c8.p44"><s sid="103" id="DS.c8.s103">Mrs Chick and Miss Tox were convoked in council at dinner next day; and when the cloth was removed, Mr Dombey opened the proceedings by requiring to be informed, without any gloss or reservation, whether there was anything the matter with Paul, and what Mr Pilkins said about him.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="DS.c8.p45" type="speech"><s sid="104" id="DS.c8.s104"><qs/>'For the child is hardly,'<qe/><sss/> said Mr Dombey, <sse/><qs/>'as stout as I could wish.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="46" id="DS.c8.p46" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="DS.c8.s105"><qs/>'My dear Paul,'<qe/><sss/> returned Mrs Chick, <sse/><qs/>'with your usual happy discrimination, which I am weak enough to envy you, every time I am in your company; and so I think is Miss Tox.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="47" id="DS.c8.p47" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="DS.c8.s106"><qs/>'Oh my dear!'<qe/><sss/> said Miss Tox, softly, <sse/><qs/>'how could it be otherwise?</s> <s sid="107" id="DS.c8.s107">Presumptuous as it is to aspire to such a level; still, if the bird of night may--but I'll not trouble Mr Dombey with the sentiment.</s> <s sid="108" id="DS.c8.s108">It merely relates to the Bulbul.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="48" id="DS.c8.p48"><s sid="109" id="DS.c8.s109">Mr Dombey bent his head in stately recognition of the Bulbuls as an old-established body.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 9. In which the Wooden Midshipman gets into Trouble</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c9.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c9.s1">That spice of romance and love of the marvellous, of which there was a pretty strong infusion in the nature of young Walter Gay, and which the guardianship of his Uncle, old Solomon Gills, had not very much weakened by the waters of stern practical experience, was the occasion of his attaching an uncommon and delightful interest to the adventure of Florence with Good Mrs Brown.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c9.s2">He pampered and cherished it in his memory, especially that part of it with which he had been associated: until it became the spoiled child of his fancy, and took its own way, and did what it liked with it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c9.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="DS.c9.s3">The recollection of those incidents, and his own share in them, may have been made the more captivating, perhaps, by the weekly dreamings of old Sol and Captain Cuttle on Sundays.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c9.s4">Hardly a Sunday passed, without mysterious references being made by one or other of those worthy chums to Richard Whittington; and the latter gentleman had even gone so far as to purchase a ballad of considerable antiquity, that had long fluttered among many others, chiefly expressive of maritime sentiments, on a dead wall in the Commercial Road: which poetical performance set forth the courtship and nuptials of a promising young coal-whipper with a certain <qs/>'lovely Peg,'<qe/> the accomplished daughter of the master and part-owner of a Newcastle collier.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c9.s5">In this stirring legend, Captain Cuttle descried a profound metaphysical bearing on the case of Walter and Florence; and it excited him so much, that on very festive occasions, as birthdays and a few other non-Dominical holidays, he would roar through the whole song in the little back parlour; making an amazing shake on the word Pe-e-eg, with which every verse concluded, in compliment to the heroine of the piece.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="DS.c9.p3"><s sid="6" id="DS.c9.s6">But a frank, free-spirited, open-hearted boy, is not much given to analysing the nature of his own feelings, however strong their hold upon him: and Walter would have found it difficult to decide this point.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c9.s7">He had a great affection for the wharf where he had encountered Florence, and for the streets (albeit not enchanting in themselves) by which they had come home.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c9.s8">The shoes that had so often tumbled off by the way, he preserved in his own room; and, sitting in the little back parlour of an evening, he had drawn a whole gallery of fancy portraits of Good Mrs Brown.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c9.s9">It may be that he became a little smarter in his dress after that memorable occasion; and he certainly liked in his leisure time to walk towards that quarter of the town where Mr Dombey's house was situated, on the vague chance of passing little Florence in the street.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c9.s10">But the sentiment of all this was as boyish and innocent as could be.</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c9.s11">Florence was very pretty, and it is pleasant to admire a pretty face.</s> <s sid="12" id="DS.c9.s12">Florence was defenceless and weak, and it was a proud thought that he had been able to render her any protection and assistance.</s> <s sid="13" id="DS.c9.s13">Florence was the most grateful little creature in the world, and it was delightful to see her bright gratitude beaming in her face.</s> <s sid="14" id="DS.c9.s14">Florence was neglected and coldly looked upon, and his breast was full of youthful interest for the slighted child in her dull, stately home.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c9.p4"><s sid="15" id="DS.c9.s15">Thus it came about that, perhaps some half-a-dozen times in the course of the year, Walter pulled off his hat to Florence in the street, and Florence would stop to shake hands.</s> <s sid="16" id="DS.c9.s16">Mrs Wickam (who, with a characteristic alteration of his name, invariably spoke of him as 'Young Graves') was so well used to this, knowing the story of their acquaintance, that she took no heed of it at all.</s> <s sid="17" id="DS.c9.s17">Miss Nipper, on the other hand, rather looked out for these occasions: her sensitive young heart being secretly propitiated by Walter's good looks, and inclining to the belief that its sentiments were responded to.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c9.p5"><s sid="18" id="DS.c9.s18">In this way, Walter, so far from forgetting or losing sight of his acquaintance with Florence, only remembered it better and better.</s> <s sid="19" id="DS.c9.s19">As to its adventurous beginning, and all those little circumstances which gave it a distinctive character and relish, he took them into account, more as a pleasant story very agreeable to his imagination, and not to be dismissed from it, than as a part of any matter of fact with which he was concerned.</s> <s sid="20" id="DS.c9.s20">They set off Florence very much, to his fancy; but not himself.</s> <s sid="21" id="DS.c9.s21">Sometimes he thought (and then he walked very fast) what a grand thing it would have been for him to have been going to sea on the day after that first meeting, and to have gone, and to have done wonders there, and to have stopped away a long time, and to have come back an Admiral of all the colours of the dolphin, or at least a Post-Captain with epaulettes of insupportable brightness, and have married Florence (then a beautiful young woman) in spite of Mr Dombey's teeth, cravat, and watch-chain, and borne her away to the blue shores of somewhere or other, triumphantly.</s> <s sid="22" id="DS.c9.s22">But these flights of fancy seldom burnished the brass plate of Dombey and Son's Offices into a tablet of golden hope, or shed a brilliant lustre on their dirty skylights; and when the Captain and Uncle Sol talked about Richard Whittington and masters' daughters, Walter felt that he understood his true position at Dombey and Son's, much better than they did.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DS.c9.p6"><s sid="23" id="DS.c9.s23">So it was that he went on doing what he had to do from day to day, in a cheerful, pains-taking, merry spirit; and saw through the sanguine complexion of Uncle Sol and Captain Cuttle; and yet entertained a thousand indistinct and visionary fancies of his own, to which theirs were work-a-day probabilities.</s> <s sid="24" id="DS.c9.s24">Such was his condition at the Pipchin period, when he looked a little older than of yore, but not much; and was the same light-footed, light-hearted, light-headed lad, as when he charged into the parlour at the head of Uncle Sol and the imaginary boarders, and lighted him to bring up the Madeira.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c13.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c13.s1">Mr Dombey's offices were in a court where there was an old-established stall of choice fruit at the corner: where perambulating merchants, of both sexes, offered for sale at any time between the hours of ten and five, slippers, pocket-books, sponges, dogs' collars, and Windsor soap; and sometimes a pointer or an oil-painting.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c13.p2"><s sid="2" id="DS.c13.s2">The pointer always came that way, with a view to the Stock Exchange, where a sporting taste (originating generally in bets of new hats) is much in vogue.</s> <s sid="3" id="DS.c13.s3">The other commodities were addressed to the general public; but they were never offered by the vendors to Mr Dombey.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c13.s4">When he appeared, the dealers in those wares fell off respectfully.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c13.s5">The principal slipper and dogs' collar man--who considered himself a public character, and whose portrait was screwed on to an artist's door in Cheapside--threw up his forefinger to the brim of his hat as Mr Dombey went by.</s> <s sid="6" id="DS.c13.s6">The ticket-porter, if he were not absent on a job, always ran officiously before, to open Mr Dombey's office door as wide as possible, and hold it open, with his hat off, while he entered.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c13.p3"><s sid="7" id="DS.c13.s7">The clerks within were not a whit behind-hand in their demonstrations of respect.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c13.s8">A solemn hush prevailed, as Mr Dombey passed through the outer office.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c13.s9">The wit of the Counting-House became in a moment as mute as the row of leathern fire-buckets hanging up behind him.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c13.s10">Such vapid and flat daylight as filtered through the ground-glass windows and skylights, leaving a black sediment upon the panes, showed the books and papers, and the figures bending over them, enveloped in a studious gloom, and as much abstracted in appearance, from the world without, as if they were assembled at the bottom of the sea; while a mouldy little strong room in the obscure perspective, where a shaded lamp was always burning, might have represented the cavern of some ocean monster, looking on with a red eye at these mysteries of the deep.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c13.p4"><s sid="11" id="DS.c13.s11">When Perch the messenger, whose place was on a little bracket, like a timepiece, saw Mr Dombey come in--or rather when he felt that he was coming, for he had usually an instinctive sense of his approach--he hurried into Mr Dombey's room, stirred the fire, carried fresh coals from the bowels of the coal-box, hung the newspaper to air upon the fender, put the chair ready, and the screen in its place, and was round upon his heel on the instant of Mr Dombey's entrance, to take his great-coat and hat, and hang them up.</s> <s sid="12" id="DS.c13.s12">Then Perch took the newspaper, and gave it a turn or two in his hands before the fire, and laid it, deferentially, at Mr Dombey's elbow.</s> <s sid="13" id="DS.c13.s13">And so little objection had Perch to being deferential in the last degree, that if he might have laid himself at Mr Dombey's feet, or might have called him by some such title as used to be bestowed upon the Caliph Haroun Alraschid, he would have been all the better pleased.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c13.p5"><s sid="14" id="DS.c13.s14">As this honour would have been an innovation and an experiment, Perch was fain to content himself by expressing as well as he could, in his manner, You are the light of my Eyes.</s> <s sid="15" id="DS.c13.s15">You are the Breath of my Soul.</s> <s sid="16" id="DS.c13.s16">You are the commander of the Faithful Perch!</s> <s sid="17" id="DS.c13.s17">With this imperfect happiness to cheer him, he would shut the door softly, walk away on tiptoe, and leave his great chief to be stared at, through a dome-shaped window in the leads, by ugly chimney-pots and backs of houses, and especially by the bold window of a hair-cutting saloon on a first floor, where a waxen effigy, bald as a Mussulman in the morning, and covered, after eleven o'clock in the day, with luxuriant hair and whiskers in the latest Christian fashion, showed him the wrong side of its head for ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DS.c13.p6"><s sid="18" id="DS.c13.s18">Between Mr Dombey and the common world, as it was accessible through the medium of the outer office--to which Mr Dombey's presence in his own room may be said to have struck like damp, or cold air--there were two degrees of descent.</s> <s sid="19" id="DS.c13.s19">Mr Carker in his own office was the first step; Mr Morfin, in his own office, was the second.</s> <s sid="20" id="DS.c13.s20">Each of these gentlemen occupied a little chamber like a bath-room, opening from the passage outside Mr Dombey's door.</s> <s sid="21" id="DS.c13.s21">Mr Carker, as Grand Vizier, inhabited the room that was nearest to the Sultan.</s> <s sid="22" id="DS.c13.s22">Mr Morfin, as an officer of inferior state, inhabited the room that was nearest to the clerks.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c14.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="DS.c14.s1">When the Midsummer vacation approached, no indecent manifestations of joy were exhibited by the leaden-eyed young gentlemen assembled at Doctor Blimber's.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c14.s2">Any such violent expression as <qs/>'breaking up,'<qe/> would have been quite inapplicable to that polite establishment.</s> <s sid="3" id="DS.c14.s3">The young gentlemen oozed away, semi-annually, to their own homes; but they never broke up.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c14.s4">They would have scorned the action.</s> </p><p pid="2" id="DS.c14.p2" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="DS.c14.s5">Tozer, who was constantly galled and tormented by a starched white cambric neckerchief, which he wore at the express desire of Mrs Tozer, his parent, who, designing him for the Church, was of opinion that he couldn't be in that forward state of preparation too soon--Tozer said, indeed, that choosing between two evils, he thought he would rather stay where he was, than go home.</s> <s sid="6" id="DS.c14.s6">However inconsistent this declaration might appear with that passage in Tozer's Essay on the subject, wherein he had observed <qs/>'that the thoughts of home and all its recollections, awakened in his mind the most pleasing emotions of anticipation and delight,'<qe/> and had also likened himself to a Roman General, flushed with a recent victory over the Iceni, or laden with Carthaginian spoil, advancing within a few hours' march of the Capitol, presupposed, for the purposes of the simile, to be the dwelling-place of Mrs Tozer, still it was very sincerely made.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c14.s7">For it seemed that Tozer had a dreadful Uncle, who not only volunteered examinations of him, in the holidays, on abstruse points, but twisted innocent events and things, and wrenched them to the same fell purpose.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c14.s8">So that if this Uncle took him to the Play, or, on a similar pretence of kindness, carried him to see a Giant, or a Dwarf, or a Conjuror, or anything, Tozer knew he had read up some classical allusion to the subject beforehand, and was thrown into a state of mortal apprehension: not foreseeing where he might break out, or what authority he might not quote against him.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="DS.c14.p3"><s sid="9" id="DS.c14.s9">As to Briggs, his father made no show of artifice about it.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c14.s10">He never would leave him alone.</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c14.s11">So numerous and severe were the mental trials of that unfortunate youth in vacation time, that the friends of the family (then resident near Bayswater, London) seldom approached the ornamental piece of water in Kensington Gardens,' without a vague expectation of seeing Master Briggs's hat floating on the surface, and an unfinished exercise lying on the bank.</s> <s sid="12" id="DS.c14.s12">Briggs, therefore, was not at all sanguine on the subject of holidays; and these two sharers of little Paul's bedroom were so fair a sample of the young gentlemen in general, that the most elastic among them contemplated the arrival of those festive periods with genteel resignation.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c14.p4"><s sid="13" id="DS.c14.s13">It was far otherwise with little Paul.</s> <s sid="14" id="DS.c14.s14">The end of these first holidays was to witness his separation from Florence, but who ever looked forward to the end of holidays whose beginning was not yet come!</s> <s sid="15" id="DS.c14.s15">Not Paul, assuredly.</s> <s sid="16" id="DS.c14.s16">As the happy time drew near, the lions and tigers climbing up the bedroom walls became quite tame and frolicsome.</s> <s sid="17" id="DS.c14.s17">The grim sly faces in the squares and diamonds of the floor-cloth, relaxed and peeped out at him with less wicked eyes.</s> <s sid="18" id="DS.c14.s18">The grave old clock had more of personal interest in the tone of its formal inquiry; and the restless sea went rolling on all night, to the sounding of a melancholy strain--yet it was pleasant too--that rose and fell with the waves, and rocked him, as it were, to sleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c14.p5"><s sid="19" id="DS.c14.s19">Mr Feeder, B.A., seemed to think that he, too, would enjoy the holidays very much.</s> <s sid="20" id="DS.c14.s20">Mr Toots projected a life of holidays from that time forth; for, as he regularly informed Paul every day, it was his 'last half' at Doctor Blimber's, and he was going to begin to come into his property directly.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DS.c14.p6"><s sid="21" id="DS.c14.s21">It was perfectly understood between Paul and Mr Toots, that they were intimate friends, notwithstanding their distance in point of years and station.</s> <s sid="22" id="DS.c14.s22">As the vacation approached, and Mr Toots breathed harder and stared oftener in Paul's society, than he had done before, Paul knew that he meant he was sorry they were going to lose sight of each other, and felt very much obliged to him for his patronage and good opinion.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DS.c14.p7" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="DS.c14.s23">It was even understood by Doctor Blimber, Mrs Blimber, and Miss Blimber, as well as by the young gentlemen in general, that Toots had somehow constituted himself protector and guardian of Dombey, and the circumstance became so notorious, even to Mrs Pipchin, that the good old creature cherished feelings of bitterness and jealousy against Toots; and, in the sanctuary of her own home, repeatedly denounced him as a <qs/>'chuckle-headed noodle.'<qe/></s> <s sid="24" id="DS.c14.s24">Whereas the innocent Toots had no more idea of awakening Mrs Pipchin's wrath, than he had of any other definite possibility or proposition.</s> <s sid="25" id="DS.c14.s25">On the contrary, he was disposed to consider her rather a remarkable character, with many points of interest about her.</s> <s sid="26" id="DS.c14.s26">For this reason he smiled on her with so much urbanity, and asked her how she did, so often, in the course of her visits to little Paul, that at last she one night told him plainly, she wasn't used to it, whatever he might think; and she could not, and she would not bear it, either from himself or any other puppy then existing: at which unexpected acknowledgment of his civilities, Mr Toots was so alarmed that he secreted himself in a retired spot until she had gone.</s> <s sid="27" id="DS.c14.s27">Nor did he ever again face the doughty Mrs Pipchin, under Doctor Blimber's roof.</s> </p><p pid="8" id="DS.c14.p8" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="DS.c14.s28">They were within two or three weeks of the holidays, when, one day, Cornelia Blimber called Paul into her room, and said, <qs/>'Dombey, I am going to send home your analysis.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="9" id="DS.c14.p9" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="DS.c14.s29"><qs/>'Thank you, Ma'am,'<qe/> returned Paul.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="DS.c14.p10" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="DS.c14.s30"><qs/>'You know what I mean, do you, Dombey?'<qe/> inquired Miss Blimber, looking hard at him, through the spectacles.</s> </p><p pid="11" id="DS.c14.p11" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="DS.c14.s31"><qs/>'No, Ma'am,'<qe/> said Paul.</s> </p><p pid="12" id="DS.c14.p12" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="DS.c14.s32"><qs/>'Dombey, Dombey,'<qe/><sss/> said Miss Blimber, <sse/><qs/>'I begin to be afraid you are a sad boy.</s> <s sid="33" id="DS.c14.s33">When you don't know the meaning of an expression, why don't you seek for information?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="DS.c14.p13" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="DS.c14.s34"><qs/>'Mrs Pipchin told me I wasn't to ask questions,'<qe/> returned Paul.</s> </p><p pid="14" id="DS.c14.p14" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="DS.c14.s35"><qs/>'I must beg you not to mention Mrs Pipchin to me, on any account, Dombey,'<qe/> returned Miss Blimber.</s> <s sid="36" id="DS.c14.s36"><qs/>'I couldn't think of allowing it.</s> <s sid="37" id="DS.c14.s37">The course of study here, is very far removed from anything of that sort.</s> <s sid="38" id="DS.c14.s38">A repetition of such allusions would make it necessary for me to request to hear, without a mistake, before breakfast-time to-morrow morning, from Verbum personale down to simillimia cygno.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="DS.c14.p15" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="DS.c14.s39"><qs/>'I didn't mean, Ma'am--'<qe/> began little Paul.</s> </p><p pid="16" id="DS.c14.p16" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="DS.c14.s40"><qs/>'I must trouble you not to tell me that you didn't mean, if you please, Dombey,'<qe/> said Miss Blimber, who preserved an awful politeness in her admonitions.</s> <s sid="41" id="DS.c14.s41"><qs/>'That is a line of argument I couldn't dream of permitting.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="17" id="DS.c14.p17"><s sid="42" id="DS.c14.s42">Paul felt it safest to say nothing at all, so he only looked at Miss Blimber's spectacles.</s> <s sid="43" id="DS.c14.s43">Miss Blimber having shaken her head at him gravely, referred to a paper lying before her.</s> </p>

Dombey."</s> <s sid="45" id="DS.c14.s45">If my recollection serves me,'<qe/><sls/> said Miss Blimber breaking off, <sle/><qs/>'the word analysis as opposed to synthesis, is thus defined by Walker.</s> <s sid="46" id="DS.c14.s46">"The resolution of an object, whether of the senses or of the intellect, into its first elements."</s> <s sid="47" id="DS.c14.s47">As opposed to synthesis, you observe.</s> <s sid="48" id="DS.c14.s48">Now you know what analysis is, Dombey.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="DS.c14.p19"><s sid="49" id="DS.c14.s49">Dombey didn't seem to be absolutely blinded by the light let in upon his intellect, but he made Miss Blimber a little bow.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="DS.c14.p20" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="DS.c14.s50"><qs/>'"Analysis,"'<qe/><sls/> resumed Miss Blimber, casting her eye over the paper, <sle/><qs/>'"of the character of P. Dombey."</s> <s sid="51" id="DS.c14.s51">I find that the natural capacity of Dombey is extremely good; and that his general disposition to study may be stated in an equal ratio.</s> <s sid="52" id="DS.c14.s52">Thus, taking eight as our standard and highest number, I find these qualities in Dombey stated each at six three-fourths!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="21" id="DS.c14.p21"><s sid="53" id="DS.c14.s53">Miss Blimber paused to see how Paul received this news.</s> <s sid="54" id="DS.c14.s54">Being undecided whether six three-fourths meant six pounds fifteen, or sixpence three farthings, or six foot three, or three quarters past six, or six somethings that he hadn't learnt yet, with three unknown something elses over, Paul rubbed his hands and looked straight at Miss Blimber.</s> <s sid="55" id="DS.c14.s55">It happened to answer as well as anything else he could have done; and Cornelia proceeded.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="DS.c14.p22" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="DS.c14.s56"><qs/>'"Violence two.</s> <s sid="57" id="DS.c14.s57">Selfishness two.</s> <s sid="58" id="DS.c14.s58">Inclination to low company, as evinced in the case of a person named Glubb, originally seven, but since reduced.</s> <s sid="59" id="DS.c14.s59">Gentlemanly demeanour four, and improving with advancing years."</s> <s sid="60" id="DS.c14.s60">Now what I particularly wish to call your attention to, Dombey, is the general observation at the close of this analysis.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="DS.c14.p23"><s sid="61" id="DS.c14.s61">Paul set himself to follow it with great care.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="DS.c14.p28"><s sid="75" id="DS.c14.s75">Little thinking that in this, he only showed again the difference between himself and his compeers, poor tiny Paul set it forth to Miss Blimber as well as he could, and begged her, in despite of the official analysis, to have the goodness to try and like him.</s> <s sid="76" id="DS.c14.s76">To Mrs Blimber, who had joined them, he preferred the same petition: and when that lady could not forbear, even in his presence, from giving utterance to her often-repeated opinion, that he was an odd child, Paul told her that he was sure she was quite right; that he thought it must be his bones, but he didn't know; and that he hoped she would overlook it, for he was fond of them all.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="DS.c14.p29" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="DS.c14.s77"><qs/>'Not so fond,'<qe/><sls/> said Paul, with a mixture of timidity and perfect frankness, which was one of the most peculiar and most engaging qualities of the child, <sle/><qs/>'not so fond as I am of Florence, of course; that could never be.</s> <s sid="78" id="DS.c14.s78">You couldn't expect that, could you, Ma'am?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="30" id="DS.c14.p30" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="DS.c14.s79"><qs/>'Oh! the old-fashioned little soul!'<qe/> cried Mrs Blimber, in a whisper.</s> </p><p pid="31" id="DS.c14.p31" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="DS.c14.s80"><qs/>'But I like everybody here very much,'<qe/><sss/> pursued Paul, <sse/><qs/>'and I should grieve to go away, and think that anyone was glad that I was gone, or didn't care.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="32" id="DS.c14.p32" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="DS.c14.s81">Mrs Blimber was now quite sure that Paul was the oddest child in the world; and when she told the Doctor what had passed, the Doctor did not controvert his wife's opinion.</s> <s sid="82" id="DS.c14.s82">But he said, as he had said before, when Paul first came, that study would do much; and he also said, as he had said on that occasion, <qs/>'Bring him on, Cornelia!</s> <s sid="83" id="DS.c14.s83">Bring him on!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="33" id="DS.c14.p33"><s sid="84" id="DS.c14.s84">Cornelia had always brought him on as vigorously as she could; and Paul had had a hard life of it.</s> <s sid="85" id="DS.c14.s85">But over and above the getting through his tasks, he had long had another purpose always present to him, and to which he still held fast.</s> <s sid="86" id="DS.c14.s86">It was, to be a gentle, useful, quiet little fellow, always striving to secure the love and attachment of the rest; and though he was yet often to be seen at his old post on the stairs, or watching the waves and clouds from his solitary window, he was oftener found, too, among the other boys, modestly rendering them some little voluntary service.</s> <s sid="87" id="DS.c14.s87">Thus it came to pass, that even among those rigid and absorbed young anchorites, who mortified themselves beneath the roof of Doctor Blimber, Paul was an object of general interest; a fragile little plaything that they all liked, and that no one would have thought of treating roughly.</s> <s sid="88" id="DS.c14.s88">But he could not change his nature, or rewrite the analysis; and so they all agreed that Dombey was old-fashioned.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="DS.c14.p34"><s sid="89" id="DS.c14.s89">There were some immunities, however, attaching to the character enjoyed by no one else.</s> <s sid="90" id="DS.c14.s90">They could have better spared a newer-fashioned child, and that alone was much.</s> <s sid="91" id="DS.c14.s91">When the others only bowed to Doctor Blimber and family on retiring for the night, Paul would stretch out his morsel of a hand, and boldly shake the Doctor's; also Mrs Blimber's; also Cornelia's.</s> <s sid="92" id="DS.c14.s92">If anybody was to be begged off from impending punishment, Paul was always the delegate.</s> <s sid="93" id="DS.c14.s93">The weak-eyed young man himself had once consulted him, in reference to a little breakage of glass and china.</s> <s sid="94" id="DS.c14.s94">And it was darkly rumoured that the butler, regarding him with favour such as that stern man had never shown before to mortal boy, had sometimes mingled porter with his table-beer to make him strong.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="DS.c14.p35"><s sid="95" id="DS.c14.s95">Over and above these extensive privileges, Paul had free right of entry to Mr Feeder's room, from which apartment he had twice led Mr Toots into the open air in a state of faintness, consequent on an unsuccessful attempt to smoke a very blunt cigar: one of a bundle which that young gentleman had covertly purchased on the shingle from a most desperate smuggler, who had acknowledged, in confidence, that two hundred pounds was the price set upon his head, dead or alive, by the Custom House.</s> <s sid="96" id="DS.c14.s96">It was a snug room, Mr Feeder's, with his bed in another little room inside of it; and a flute, which Mr Feeder couldn't play yet, but was going to make a point of learning, he said, hanging up over the fireplace.</s> <s sid="97" id="DS.c14.s97">There were some books in it, too, and a fishing-rod; for Mr Feeder said he should certainly make a point of learning to fish, when he could find time.</s> <s sid="98" id="DS.c14.s98">Mr Feeder had amassed, with similar intentions, a beautiful little curly secondhand key-bugle, a chess-board and men, a Spanish Grammar, a set of sketching materials, and a pair of boxing-gloves.</s> <s sid="99" id="DS.c14.s99">The art of self-defence Mr Feeder said he should undoubtedly make a point of learning, as he considered it the duty of every man to do; for it might lead to the protection of a female in distress.</s> <s sid="100" id="DS.c14.s100">But Mr Feeder's great possession was a large green jar of snuff, which Mr Toots had brought down as a present, at the close of the last vacation; and for which he had paid a high price, having been the genuine property of the Prince Regent.</s> <s sid="101" id="DS.c14.s101">Neither Mr Toots nor Mr Feeder could partake of this or any other snuff, even in the most stinted and moderate degree, without being seized with convulsions of sneezing.</s> <s sid="102" id="DS.c14.s102">Nevertheless it was their great delight to moisten a box-full with cold tea, stir it up on a piece of parchment with a paper-knife, and devote themselves to its consumption then and there.</s> <s sid="103" id="DS.c14.s103">In the course of which cramming of their noses, they endured surprising torments with the constancy of martyrs: and, drinking table-beer at intervals, felt all the glories of dissipation.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="DS.c14.p36"><s sid="104" id="DS.c14.s104">To little Paul sitting silent in their company, and by the side of his chief patron, Mr Toots, there was a dread charm in these reckless occasions: and when Mr Feeder spoke of the dark mysteries of London, and told Mr Toots that he was going to observe it himself closely in all its ramifications in the approaching holidays, and for that purpose had made arrangements to board with two old maiden ladies at Peckham, Paul regarded him as if he were the hero of some book of travels or wild adventure, and was almost afraid of such a slashing person.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="DS.c14.p37" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="DS.c14.s105">Going into this room one evening, when the holidays were very near, Paul found Mr Feeder filling up the blanks in some printed letters, while some others, already filled up and strewn before him, were being folded and sealed by Mr Toots.</s> <s sid="106" id="DS.c14.s106">Mr Feeder said, <qs/>'Aha, Dombey, there you are, are you?'<qe/><sls/>--for they were always kind to him, and glad to see him--and then said, tossing one of the letters towards him, <sle/><qs/>'And there you are, too, Dombey.</s> <s sid="107" id="DS.c14.s107">That's yours.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="38" id="DS.c14.p38" type="speech"><s sid="108" id="DS.c14.s108"><qs/>'Mine, Sir?'<qe/> said Paul.</s> </p><p pid="39" id="DS.c14.p39" type="speech"><s sid="109" id="DS.c14.s109"><qs/>'Your invitation,'<qe/> returned Mr Feeder.</s> </p><p pid="40" id="DS.c14.p40"><s sid="110" id="DS.c14.s110">Paul, looking at it, found, in copper-plate print, with the exception of his own name and the date, which were in Mr Feeder's penmanship, that Doctor and Mrs Blimber requested the pleasure of Mr P. Dombey's company at an early party on Wednesday Evening the Seventeenth Instant; and that the hour was half-past seven o'clock; and that the object was Quadrilles.</s> <s sid="111" id="DS.c14.s111">Mr Toots also showed him, by holding up a companion sheet of paper, that Doctor and Mrs Blimber requested the pleasure of Mr Toots's company at an early party on Wednesday Evening the Seventeenth Instant, when the hour was half-past seven o'clock, and when the object was Quadrilles.</s> <s sid="112" id="DS.c14.s112">He also found, on glancing at the table where Mr Feeder sat, that the pleasure of Mr Briggs's company, and of Mr Tozer's company, and of every young gentleman's company, was requested by Doctor and Mrs Blimber on the same genteel Occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="DS.c14.p41"><s sid="113" id="DS.c14.s113">Mr Feeder then told him, to his great joy, that his sister was invited, and that it was a half-yearly event, and that, as the holidays began that day, he could go away with his sister after the party, if he liked, which Paul interrupted him to say he would like, very much.</s> <s sid="114" id="DS.c14.s114">Mr Feeder then gave him to understand that he would be expected to inform Doctor and Mrs Blimber, in superfine small-hand, that Mr P. Dombey would be happy to have the honour of waiting on them, in accordance with their polite invitation.</s> <s sid="115" id="DS.c14.s115">Lastly, Mr Feeder said, he had better not refer to the festive occasion, in the hearing of Doctor and Mrs Blimber; as these preliminaries, and the whole of the arrangements, were conducted on principles of classicality and high breeding; and that Doctor and Mrs Blimber on the one hand, and the young gentlemen on the other, were supposed, in their scholastic capacities, not to have the least idea of what was in the wind.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 15. Amazing Artfulness of Captain Cuttle, and a new Pursuit for Walter Gay</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c15.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c15.s1">Walter could not, for several days, decide what to do in the Barbados business; and even cherished some faint hope that Mr Dombey might not have meant what he had said, or that he might change his mind, and tell him he was not to go.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c15.s2">But as nothing occurred to give this idea (which was sufficiently improbable in itself) any touch of confirmation, and as time was slipping by, and he had none to lose, he felt that he must act, without hesitating any longer.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c15.p2"><s sid="3" id="DS.c15.s3">Walter's chief difficulty was, how to break the change in his affairs to Uncle Sol, to whom he was sensible it would be a terrible blow.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c15.s4">He had the greater difficulty in dashing Uncle Sol's spirits with such an astounding piece of intelligence, because they had lately recovered very much, and the old man had become so cheerful, that the little back parlour was itself again.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c15.s5">Uncle Sol had paid the first appointed portion of the debt to Mr Dombey, and was hopeful of working his way through the rest; and to cast him down afresh, when he had sprung up so manfully from his troubles, was a very distressing necessity.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c15.p3"><s sid="6" id="DS.c15.s6">Yet it would never do to run away from him.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c15.s7">He must know of it beforehand; and how to tell him was the point.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c15.s8">As to the question of going or not going, Walter did not consider that he had any power of choice in the matter.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c15.s9">Mr Dombey had truly told him that he was young, and that his Uncle's circumstances were not good; and Mr Dombey had plainly expressed, in the glance with which he had accompanied that reminder, that if he declined to go he might stay at home if he chose, but not in his counting-house.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c15.s10">His Uncle and he lay under a great obligation to Mr Dombey, which was of Walter's own soliciting.</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c15.s11">He might have begun in secret to despair of ever winning that gentleman's favour, and might have thought that he was now and then disposed to put a slight upon him, which was hardly just.</s> <s sid="12" id="DS.c15.s12">But what would have been duty without that, was still duty with it--or Walter thought so--and duty must be done.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c15.p4"><s sid="13" id="DS.c15.s13">When Mr Dombey had looked at him, and told him he was young, and that his Uncle's circumstances were not good, there had been an expression of disdain in his face; a contemptuous and disparaging assumption that he would be quite content to live idly on a reduced old man, which stung the boy's generous soul.</s> <s sid="14" id="DS.c15.s14">Determined to assure Mr Dombey, in so far as it was possible to give him the assurance without expressing it in words, that indeed he mistook his nature, Walter had been anxious to show even more cheerfulness and activity after the West Indian interview than he had shown before: if that were possible, in one of his quick and zealous disposition.</s> <s sid="15" id="DS.c15.s15">He was too young and inexperienced to think, that possibly this very quality in him was not agreeable to Mr Dombey, and that it was no stepping-stone to his good opinion to be elastic and hopeful of pleasing under the shadow of his powerful displeasure, whether it were right or wrong.</s> <s sid="16" id="DS.c15.s16">But it may have been--it may have been--that the great man thought himself defied in this new exposition of an honest spirit, and purposed to bring it down.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c15.p5" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="DS.c15.s17"><qs/>'Well! at last and at least, Uncle Sol must be told,'<qe/> thought Walter, with a sigh.</s> <s sid="18" id="DS.c15.s18">And as Walter was apprehensive that his voice might perhaps quaver a little, and that his countenance might not be quite as hopeful as he could wish it to be, if he told the old man himself, and saw the first effects of his communication on his wrinkled face, he resolved to avail himself of the services of that powerful mediator, Captain Cuttle.</s> <s sid="19" id="DS.c15.s19">Sunday coming round, he set off therefore, after breakfast, once more to beat up Captain Cuttle's quarters.</s> </p><p pid="6" id="DS.c15.p6"><s sid="20" id="DS.c15.s20">It was not unpleasant to remember, on the way thither, that Mrs MacStinger resorted to a great distance every Sunday morning, to attend the ministry of the Reverend Melchisedech Howler, who, having been one day discharged from the West India Docks on a false suspicion (got up expressly against him by the general enemy) of screwing gimlets into puncheons, and applying his lips to the orifice, had announced the destruction of the world for that day two years, at ten in the morning, and opened a front parlour for the reception of ladies and gentlemen of the Ranting persuasion, upon whom, on the first occasion of their assemblage, the admonitions of the Reverend Melchisedech had produced so powerful an effect, that, in their rapturous performance of a sacred jig, which closed the service, the whole flock broke through into a kitchen below, and disabled a mangle belonging to one of the fold.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DS.c15.p7"><s sid="21" id="DS.c15.s21">This the Captain, in a moment of uncommon conviviality, had confided to Walter and his Uncle, between the repetitions of lovely Peg, on the night when Brogley the broker was paid out.</s> <s sid="22" id="DS.c15.s22">The Captain himself was punctual in his attendance at a church in his own neighbourhood, which hoisted the Union Jack every Sunday morning; and where he was good enough--the lawful beadle being infirm--to keep an eye upon the boys, over whom he exercised great power, in virtue of his mysterious hook.</s> <s sid="23" id="DS.c15.s23">Knowing the regularity of the Captain's habits, Walter made all the haste he could, that he might anticipate his going out; and he made such good speed, that he had the pleasure, on turning into Brig Place, to behold the broad blue coat and waistcoat hanging out of the Captain's open window, to air in the sun.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="DS.c15.p8"><s sid="24" id="DS.c15.s24">It appeared incredible that the coat and waistcoat could be seen by mortal eyes without the Captain; but he certainly was not in them, otherwise his legs--the houses in Brig Place not being lofty--would have obstructed the street door, which was perfectly clear.</s> <s sid="25" id="DS.c15.s25">Quite wondering at this discovery, Walter gave a single knock.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="DS.c15.p9" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="DS.c15.s26"><qs/>'Stinger,'<qe/> he distinctly heard the Captain say, up in his room, as if that were no business of his.</s> <s sid="27" id="DS.c15.s27">Therefore Walter gave two knocks.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="DS.c15.p10" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="DS.c15.s28"><qs/>'Cuttle,'<qe/> he heard the Captain say upon that; and immediately afterwards the Captain, in his clean shirt and braces, with his neckerchief hanging loosely round his throat like a coil of rope, and his glazed hat on, appeared at the window, leaning out over the broad blue coat and waistcoat.</s> </p><p pid="11" id="DS.c15.p11" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="DS.c15.s29"><qs/>'Wal'r!'<qe/> cried the Captain, looking down upon him in amazement.</s> </p><p pid="12" id="DS.c15.p12" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="DS.c15.s30"><qs/>'Ay, ay, Captain Cuttle,'<qe/> returned Walter, 'only me'</s> </p><p pid="13" id="DS.c15.p13" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="DS.c15.s31"><qs/>'What's the matter, my lad?'<qe/> inquired the Captain, with great concern.</s> <s sid="32" id="DS.c15.s32"><qs/>'Gills an't been and sprung nothing again?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="DS.c15.p14" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="DS.c15.s33"><qs/>'No, no,'<qe/> said Walter.</s> <s sid="34" id="DS.c15.s34"><qs/>'My Uncle's all right, Captain Cuttle.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="DS.c15.p15"><s sid="35" id="DS.c15.s35">The Captain expressed his gratification, and said he would come down below and open the door, which he did.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 17. Captain Cuttle does a little Business for the Young People</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c17.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c17.s1">Captain Cuttle, in the exercise of that surprising talent for deep-laid and unfathomable scheming, with which (as is not unusual in men of transparent simplicity) he sincerely believed himself to be endowed by nature, had gone to Mr Dombey's house on the eventful Sunday, winking all the way as a vent for his superfluous sagacity, and had presented himself in the full lustre of the ankle-jacks before the eyes of Towlinson.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c17.s2">Hearing from that individual, to his great concern, of the impending calamity, Captain Cuttle, in his delicacy, sheered off again confounded; merely handing in the nosegay as a small mark of his solicitude, and leaving his respectful compliments for the family in general, which he accompanied with an expression of his hope that they would lay their heads well to the wind under existing circumstances, and a friendly intimation that he would 'look up again' to-morrow.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c17.p2"><s sid="3" id="DS.c17.s3">The Captain's compliments were never heard of any more.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c17.s4">The Captain's nosegay, after lying in the hall all night, was swept into the dust-bin next morning; and the Captain's sly arrangement, involved in one catastrophe with greater hopes and loftier designs, was crushed to pieces.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c17.s5">So, when an avalanche bears down a mountain-forest, twigs and bushes suffer with the trees, and all perish together.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c17.p3"><s sid="6" id="DS.c17.s6">When Walter returned home on the Sunday evening from his long walk, and its memorable close, he was too much occupied at first by the tidings he had to give them, and by the emotions naturally awakened in his breast by the scene through which he had passed, to observe either that his Uncle was evidently unacquainted with the intelligence the Captain had undertaken to impart, or that the Captain made signals with his hook, warning him to avoid the subject.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c17.s7">Not that the Captain's signals were calculated to have proved very comprehensible, however attentively observed; for, like those Chinese sages who are said in their conferences to write certain learned words in the air that are wholly impossible of pronunciation, the Captain made such waves and flourishes as nobody without a previous knowledge of his mystery, would have been at all likely to understand.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c17.p4"><s sid="8" id="DS.c17.s8">Captain Cuttle, however, becoming cognisant of what had happened, relinquished these attempts, as he perceived the slender chance that now existed of his being able to obtain a little easy chat with Mr Dombey before the period of Walter's departure.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c17.s9">But in admitting to himself, with a disappointed and crestfallen countenance, that Sol Gills must be told, and that Walter must go--taking the case for the present as he found it, and not having it enlightened or improved beforehand by the knowing management of a friend--the Captain still felt an unabated confidence that he, Ned Cuttle, was the man for Mr Dombey; and that, to set Walter's fortunes quite square, nothing was wanted but that they two should come together.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c17.s10">For the Captain never could forget how well he and Mr Dombey had got on at Brighton; with what nicety each of them had put in a word when it was wanted; how exactly they had taken one another's measure; nor how Ned Cuttle had pointed out that resources in the first extremity, and had brought the interview to the desired termination.</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c17.s11">On all these grounds the Captain soothed himself with thinking that though Ned Cuttle was forced by the pressure of events to 'stand by' almost useless for the present, Ned would fetch up with a wet sail in good time, and carry all before him.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c17.p5"><s sid="12" id="DS.c17.s12">Under the influence of this good-natured delusion, Captain Cuttle even went so far as to revolve in his own bosom, while he sat looking at Walter and listening with a tear on his shirt-collar to what he related, whether it might not be at once genteel and politic to give Mr Dombey a verbal invitation, whenever they should meet, to come and cut his mutton in Brig Place on some day of his own naming, and enter on the question of his young friend's prospects over a social glass.</s> <s sid="13" id="DS.c17.s13">But the uncertain temper of Mrs MacStinger, and the possibility of her setting up her rest in the passage during such an entertainment, and there delivering some homily of an uncomplimentary nature, operated as a check on the Captain's hospitable thoughts, and rendered him timid of giving them encouragement.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DS.c17.p6"><s sid="14" id="DS.c17.s14">One fact was quite clear to the Captain, as Walter, sitting thoughtfully over his untasted dinner, dwelt on all that had happened; namely, that however Walter's modesty might stand in the way of his perceiving it himself, he was, as one might say, a member of Mr Dombey's family.</s> <s sid="15" id="DS.c17.s15">He had been, in his own person, connected with the incident he so pathetically described; he had been by name remembered and commended in close association with it; and his fortunes must have a particular interest in his employer's eyes.</s> <s sid="16" id="DS.c17.s16">If the Captain had any lurking doubt whatever of his own conclusions, he had not the least doubt that they were good conclusions for the peace of mind of the Instrument-maker.</s> <s sid="17" id="DS.c17.s17">Therefore he availed himself of so favourable a moment for breaking the West Indian intelligence to his friend, as a piece of extraordinary preferment; declaring that for his part he would freely give a hundred thousand pounds (if he had it) for Walter's gain in the long-run, and that he had no doubt such an investment would yield a handsome premium.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DS.c17.p7"><s sid="18" id="DS.c17.s18">Solomon Gills was at first stunned by the communication, which fell upon the little back-parlour like a thunderbolt, and tore up the hearth savagely.</s> <s sid="19" id="DS.c17.s19">But the Captain flashed such golden prospects before his dim sight: hinted so mysteriously at 'Whittingtonian consequences; laid such emphasis on what Walter had just now told them: and appealed to it so confidently as a corroboration of his predictions, and a great advance towards the realisation of the romantic legend of Lovely Peg: that he bewildered the old man.</s> <s sid="20" id="DS.c17.s20">Walter, for his part, feigned to be so full of hope and ardour, and so sure of coming home again soon, and backed up the Captain with such expressive shakings of his head and rubbings of his hands, that Solomon, looking first at him then at Captain Cuttle, began to think he ought to be transported with joy.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c20.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="DS.c20.s1"><qs/>'Mr Dombey, Sir,'<qe/><sss/> said Major Bagstock, <sse/><qs/>'Joee' B. is not in general a man of sentiment, for Joseph is tough.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c20.s2">But Joe has his feelings, Sir, and when they are awakened--Damme, Mr Dombey,'<qe/><sls/> cried the Major with sudden ferocity, <sle/><qs/>'this is weakness, and I won't submit to it!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="2" id="DS.c20.p2"><s sid="3" id="DS.c20.s3">Major Bagstock delivered himself of these expressions on receiving Mr Dombey as his guest at the head of his own staircase in Princess's Place.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c20.s4">Mr Dombey had come to breakfast with the Major, previous to their setting forth on their trip; and the ill-starved Native had already undergone a world of misery arising out of the muffins, while, in connexion with the general question of boiled eggs, life was a burden to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c20.p3" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="DS.c20.s5"><qs/>'It is not for an old soldier of the Bagstock breed,'<qe/><sls/> observed the Major, relapsing into a mild state, <sle/><qs/>'to deliver himself up, a prey to his own emotions; but--damme, Sir,'<qe/><sls/> cried the Major, in another spasm of ferocity, <sle/><qs/>'I condole with you!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="4" id="DS.c20.p4"><s sid="6" id="DS.c20.s6">The Major's purple visage deepened in its hue, and the Major's lobster eyes stood out in bolder relief, as he shook Mr Dombey by the hand, imparting to that peaceful action as defiant a character as if it had been the prelude to his immediately boxing Mr Dombey for a thousand pounds a side and the championship of England.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c20.s7">With a rotatory motion of his head, and a wheeze very like the cough of a horse, the Major then conducted his visitor to the sitting-room, and there welcomed him (having now composed his feelings) with the freedom and frankness of a travelling companion.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c20.p5" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="DS.c20.s8"><qs/>'Dombey,'<qe/><sss/> said the Major, <sse/><qs/>'I'm glad to see you.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c20.s9">I'm proud to see you.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c20.s10">There are not many men in Europe to whom J.

<p pid="9" id="DS.c20.p9"><s sid="23" id="DS.c20.s23">And if it were ever consolatory to know this, or the like of this, it was consolatory then, when the impotence of his will, the instability of his hopes, the feebleness of wealth, had been so direfully impressed upon him.</s> <s sid="24" id="DS.c20.s24">What could it do, his boy had asked him.</s> <s sid="25" id="DS.c20.s25">Sometimes, thinking of the baby question, he could hardly forbear inquiring, himself, what could it do indeed: what had it done?</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="DS.c20.p10"><s sid="26" id="DS.c20.s26">But these were lonely thoughts, bred late at night in the sullen despondency and gloom of his retirement, and pride easily found its reassurance in many testimonies to the truth, as unimpeachable and precious as the Major's.</s> <s sid="27" id="DS.c20.s27">Mr Dombey, in his friendlessness, inclined to the Major.</s> <s sid="28" id="DS.c20.s28">It cannot be said that he warmed towards him, but he thawed a little, The Major had had some part--and not too much--in the days by the seaside.</s> <s sid="29" id="DS.c20.s29">He was a man of the world, and knew some great people.</s> <s sid="30" id="DS.c20.s30">He talked much, and told stories; and Mr Dombey was disposed to regard him as a choice spirit who shone in society, and who had not that poisonous ingredient of poverty with which choice spirits in general are too much adulterated.</s> <s sid="31" id="DS.c20.s31">His station was undeniable.</s> <s sid="32" id="DS.c20.s32">Altogether the Major was a creditable companion, well accustomed to a life of leisure, and to such places as that they were about to visit, and having an air of gentlemanly ease about him that mixed well enough with his own City character, and did not compete with it at all.</s> <s sid="33" id="DS.c20.s33">If Mr Dombey had any lingering idea that the Major, as a man accustomed, in the way of his calling, to make light of the ruthless hand that had lately crushed his hopes, might unconsciously impart some useful philosophy to him, and scare away his weak regrets, he hid it from himself, and left it lying at the bottom of his pride, unexamined.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="DS.c20.p11" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="DS.c20.s34"><qs/>'Where is my scoundrel?'<qe/> said the Major, looking wrathfully round the room.</s> </p><p pid="12" id="DS.c20.p12"><s sid="35" id="DS.c20.s35">The Native, who had no particular name, but answered to any vituperative epithet, presented himself instantly at the door and ventured to come no nearer.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="DS.c20.p13" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="DS.c20.s36"><qs/>'You villain!'<qe/><sss/> said the choleric Major, <sse/><qs/>'where's the breakfast?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="DS.c20.p14"><s sid="37" id="DS.c20.s37">The dark servant disappeared in search of it, and was quickly heard reascending the stairs in such a tremulous state, that the plates and dishes on the tray he carried, trembling sympathetically as he came, rattled again, all the way up.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="DS.c20.p15" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="DS.c20.s38"><qs/>'Dombey,'<qe/> said the Major, glancing at the Native as he arranged the table, and encouraging him with an awful shake of his fist when he upset a spoon, 'here is a devilled grill, a savoury pie, a dish of kidneys, and so forth.</s> <s sid="39" id="DS.c20.s39">Pray sit down.</s> <s sid="40" id="DS.c20.s40">Old Joe can give you nothing but camp fare, you see.</s> </p><p pid="16" id="DS.c20.p16" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="DS.c20.s41"><qs/>'Very excellent fare, Major,'<qe/> replied his guest; and not in mere politeness either; for the Major always took the best possible care of himself, and indeed ate rather more of rich meats than was good for him, insomuch that his Imperial complexion was mainly referred by the faculty to that circumstance.</s> </p><p pid="17" id="DS.c20.p17" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="DS.c20.s42"><qs/>'You have been looking over the way, Sir,'<qe/> observed the Major.</s> <s sid="43" id="DS.c20.s43"><qs/>'Have you seen our friend?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="18" id="DS.c20.p18" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="DS.c20.s44"><qs/>'You mean Miss Tox,'<qe/> retorted Mr Dombey.</s> <s sid="45" id="DS.c20.s45"><qs/>'No.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="DS.c20.p19" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="DS.c20.s46"><qs/>'Charming woman, Sir,'<qe/> said the Major, with a fat laugh rising in his short throat, and nearly suffocating him.</s> </p><p pid="20" id="DS.c20.p20" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="DS.c20.s47"><qs/>'Miss Tox is a very good sort of person, I believe,'<qe/> replied Mr Dombey.</s> </p><p pid="21" id="DS.c20.p21"><s sid="48" id="DS.c20.s48">The haughty coldness of the reply seemed to afford Major Bagstock infinite delight.</s> <s sid="49" id="DS.c20.s49">He swelled and swelled, exceedingly: and even laid down his knife and fork for a moment, to rub his hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="DS.c20.p26" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="DS.c20.s57"><qs/>'I beg your pardon,'<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="58" id="DS.c20.s58"><qs/>'I see you are in earnest.</s> <s sid="59" id="DS.c20.s59">I tell you what, Dombey.'<qe/></s> <s sid="60" id="DS.c20.s60">The Major paused in his eating, and looked mysteriously indignant.</s> <s sid="61" id="DS.c20.s61"><qs/>'That's a de-vilish ambitious woman, Sir.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="27" id="DS.c20.p27" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="DS.c20.s62">Mr Dombey said <qs/>'Indeed?'<qe/> with frigid indifference: mingled perhaps with some contemptuous incredulity as to Miss Tox having the presumption to harbour such a superior quality.</s> </p><p pid="28" id="DS.c20.p28" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="DS.c20.s63"><qs/>'That woman, Sir,'<qe/><sss/> said the Major, <sse/><qs/>'is, in her way, a Lucifer.</s> <s sid="64" id="DS.c20.s64">Joey B. has had his day, Sir, but he keeps his eyes.</s> <s sid="65" id="DS.c20.s65">He sees, does Joe.</s> <s sid="66" id="DS.c20.s66">His Royal Highness the late Duke of York observed of Joey, at a levee, that he saw.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="29" id="DS.c20.p29"><s sid="67" id="DS.c20.s67">The Major accompanied this with such a look, and, between eating, drinking, hot tea, devilled grill, muffins, and meaning, was altogether so swollen and inflamed about the head, that even Mr Dombey showed some anxiety for him.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="DS.c20.p48"><s sid="109" id="DS.c20.s109">But before the carriage moved away, and while the Native was in the act of sepulture, Miss Tox appearing at her window, waved a lilywhite handkerchief.</s> <s sid="110" id="DS.c20.s110">Mr Dombey received this parting salutation very coldly--very coldly even for him--and honouring her with the slightest possible inclination of his head, leaned back in the carriage with a very discontented look.</s> <s sid="111" id="DS.c20.s111">His marked behaviour seemed to afford the Major (who was all politeness in his recognition of Miss Tox) unbounded satisfaction; and he sat for a long time afterwards, leering, and choking, like an over-fed Mephistopheles.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="DS.c20.p49"><s sid="112" id="DS.c20.s112">During the bustle of preparation at the railway, Mr Dombey and the Major walked up and down the platform side by side; the former taciturn and gloomy, and the latter entertaining him, or entertaining himself, with a variety of anecdotes and reminiscences, in most of which Joe Bagstock was the principal performer.</s> <s sid="113" id="DS.c20.s113">Neither of the two observed that in the course of these walks, they attracted the attention of a working man who was standing near the engine, and who touched his hat every time they passed; for Mr Dombey habitually looked over the vulgar herd, not at them; and the Major was looking, at the time, into the core of one of his stories.</s> <s sid="114" id="DS.c20.s114">At length, however, this man stepped before them as they turned round, and pulling his hat off, and keeping it off, ducked his head to Mr Dombey.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 22. A Trifle of Management by Mr Carker the Manager</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c22.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c22.s1">Mr Carker the Manager sat at his desk, smooth and soft as usual, reading those letters which were reserved for him to open, backing them occasionally with such memoranda and references as their business purport required, and parcelling them out into little heaps for distribution through the several departments of the House.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c22.s2">The post had come in heavy that morning, and Mr Carker the Manager had a good deal to do.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c22.p2"><s sid="3" id="DS.c22.s3">The general action of a man so engaged--pausing to look over a bundle of papers in his hand, dealing them round in various portions, taking up another bundle and examining its contents with knitted brows and pursed-out lips--dealing, and sorting, and pondering by turns--would easily suggest some whimsical resemblance to a player at cards.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c22.s4">The face of Mr Carker the Manager was in good keeping with such a fancy.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c22.s5">It was the face of a man who studied his play, warily: who made himself master of all the strong and weak points of the game: who registered the cards in his mind as they fell about him, knew exactly what was on them, what they missed, and what they made: who was crafty to find out what the other players held, and who never betrayed his own hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c22.p3"><s sid="6" id="DS.c22.s6">The letters were in various languages, but Mr Carker the Manager read them all.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c22.s7">If there had been anything in the offices of Dombey and Son that he could read, there would have been a card wanting in the pack.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c22.s8">He read almost at a glance, and made combinations of one letter with another and one business with another as he went on, adding new matter to the heaps--much as a man would know the cards at sight, and work out their combinations in his mind after they were turned.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c22.s9">Something too deep for a partner, and much too deep for an adversary, Mr Carker the Manager sat in the rays of the sun that came down slanting on him through the skylight, playing his game alone.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 23. Florence solitary, and the Midshipman mysterious</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c23.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c23.s1">Florence lived alone in the great dreary house, and day succeeded day, and still she lived alone; and the blank walls looked down upon her with a vacant stare, as if they had a Gorgon-like mind to stare her youth and beauty into stone.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c23.p2"><s sid="2" id="DS.c23.s2">No magic dwelling-place in magic story, shut up in the heart of a thick wood, was ever more solitary and deserted to the fancy, than was her father's mansion in its grim reality, as it stood lowering on the street: always by night, when lights were shining from neighbouring windows, a blot upon its scanty brightness; always by day, a frown upon its never-smiling face.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c23.p3" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="DS.c23.s3">There were not two dragon sentries keeping ward before the gate of this above, as in magic legend are usually found on duty over the wronged innocence imprisoned; but besides a glowering visage, with its thin lips parted wickedly, that surveyed all comers from above the archway of the door, there was a monstrous fantasy of rusty iron, curling and twisting like a petrifaction of an arbour over threshold, budding in spikes and corkscrew points, and bearing, one on either side, two ominous extinguishers, that seemed to say, <qs/>'Who enter here, leave light behind!'<qe/></s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c23.s4">There were no talismanic characters engraven on the portal, but the house was now so neglected in appearance, that boys chalked the railings and the pavement--particularly round the corner where the side wall was--and drew ghosts on the stable door; and being sometimes driven off by Mr Towlinson, made portraits of him, in return, with his ears growing out horizontally from under his hat.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c23.s5">Noise ceased to be, within the shadow of the roof.</s> <s sid="6" id="DS.c23.s6">The brass band that came into the street once a week, in the morning, never brayed a note in at those windows; but all such company, down to a poor little piping organ of weak intellect, with an imbecile party of automaton dancers, waltzing in and out at folding-doors, fell off from it with one accord, and shunned it as a hopeless place.</s> </p><p pid="4" id="DS.c23.p4"><s sid="7" id="DS.c23.s7">The spell upon it was more wasting than the spell that used to set enchanted houses sleeping once upon a time, but left their waking freshness unimpaired.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c23.s8">The passive desolation of disuse was everywhere silently manifest about it.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c23.s9">Within doors, curtains, drooping heavily, lost their old folds and shapes, and hung like cumbrous palls.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c23.s10">Hecatombs of furniture, still piled and covered up, shrunk like imprisoned and forgotten men, and changed insensibly.</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c23.s11">Mirrors were dim as with the breath of years.</s> <s sid="12" id="DS.c23.s12">Patterns of carpets faded and became perplexed and faint, like the memory of those years' trifling incidents.</s> <s sid="13" id="DS.c23.s13">Boards, starting at unwonted footsteps, creaked and shook.</s> <s sid="14" id="DS.c23.s14">Keys rusted in the locks of doors.</s> <s sid="15" id="DS.c23.s15">Damp started on the walls, and as the stains came out, the pictures seemed to go in and secrete themselves.</s> <s sid="16" id="DS.c23.s16">Mildew and mould began to lurk in closets.</s> <s sid="17" id="DS.c23.s17">Fungus trees grew in corners of the cellars.</s> <s sid="18" id="DS.c23.s18">Dust accumulated, nobody knew whence nor how; spiders, moths, and grubs were heard of every day.</s> <s sid="19" id="DS.c23.s19">An exploratory blackbeetle now and then was found immovable upon the stairs, or in an upper room, as wondering how he got there.</s> <s sid="20" id="DS.c23.s20">Rats began to squeak and scuffle in the night time, through dark galleries they mined behind the panelling.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c23.p5"><s sid="21" id="DS.c23.s21">The dreary magnificence of the state rooms, seen imperfectly by the doubtful light admitted through closed shutters, would have answered well enough for an enchanted abode.</s> <s sid="22" id="DS.c23.s22">Such as the tarnished paws of gilded lions, stealthily put out from beneath their wrappers; the marble lineaments of busts on pedestals, fearfully revealing themselves through veils; the clocks that never told the time, or, if wound up by any chance, told it wrong, and struck unearthly numbers, which are not upon the dial; the accidental tinklings among the pendant lustres, more startling than alarm-bells; the softened sounds and laggard air that made their way among these objects, and a phantom crowd of others, shrouded and hooded, and made spectral of shape.</s> <s sid="23" id="DS.c23.s23">But, besides, there was the great staircase, where the lord of the place so rarely set his foot, and by which his little child had gone up to Heaven.</s> <s sid="24" id="DS.c23.s24">There were other staircases and passages where no one went for weeks together; there were two closed rooms associated with dead members of the family, and with whispered recollections of them; and to all the house but Florence, there was a gentle figure moving through the solitude and gloom, that gave to every lifeless thing a touch of present human interest and wonder.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DS.c23.p6"><s sid="25" id="DS.c23.s25">For Florence lived alone in the deserted house, and day succeeded day, and still she lived alone, and the cold walls looked down upon her with a vacant stare, as if they had a Gorgon-like mind to stare her youth and beauty into stone.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DS.c23.p7"><s sid="26" id="DS.c23.s26">The grass began to grow upon the roof, and in the crevices of the basement paving.</s> <s sid="27" id="DS.c23.s27">A scaly crumbling vegetation sprouted round the window-sills.</s> <s sid="28" id="DS.c23.s28">Fragments of mortar lost their hold upon the insides of the unused chimneys, and came dropping down.</s> <s sid="29" id="DS.c23.s29">The two trees with the smoky trunks were blighted high up, and the withered branches domineered above the leaves, Through the whole building white had turned yellow, yellow nearly black; and since the time when the poor lady died, it had slowly become a dark gap in the long monotonous street.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="DS.c23.p8"><s sid="30" id="DS.c23.s30">But Florence bloomed there, like the king's fair daughter in the story.</s> <s sid="31" id="DS.c23.s31">Her books, her music, and her daily teachers, were her only real companions, Susan Nipper and Diogenes excepted: of whom the former, in her attendance on the studies of her young mistress, began to grow quite learned herself, while the latter, softened possibly by the same influences, would lay his head upon the window-ledge, and placidly open and shut his eyes upon the street, all through a summer morning; sometimes pricking up his head to look with great significance after some noisy dog in a cart, who was barking his way along, and sometimes, with an exasperated and unaccountable recollection of his supposed enemy in the neighbourhood, rushing to the door, whence, after a deafening disturbance, he would come jogging back with a ridiculous complacency that belonged to him, and lay his jaw upon the window-ledge again, with the air of a dog who had done a public service.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="DS.c23.p9"><s sid="32" id="DS.c23.s32">So Florence lived in her wilderness of a home, within the circle of her innocent pursuits and thoughts, and nothing harmed her.</s> <s sid="33" id="DS.c23.s33">She could go down to her father's rooms now, and think of him, and suffer her loving heart humbly to approach him, without fear of repulse.</s> <s sid="34" id="DS.c23.s34">She could look upon the objects that had surrounded him in his sorrow, and could nestle near his chair, and not dread the glance that she so well remembered.</s> <s sid="35" id="DS.c23.s35">She could render him such little tokens of her duty and service' as putting everything in order for him with her own hands, binding little nosegays for table, changing them as one by one they withered and he did not come back, preparing something for him every' day, and leaving some timid mark of her presence near his usual seat.</s> <s sid="36" id="DS.c23.s36">To-day, it was a little painted stand for his watch; tomorrow she would be afraid to leave it, and would substitute some other trifle of her making not so likely to attract his eye.</s> <s sid="37" id="DS.c23.s37">Waking in the night, perhaps, she would tremble at the thought of his coming home and angrily rejecting it, and would hurry down with slippered feet and quickly beating heart, and bring it away.</s> <s sid="38" id="DS.c23.s38">At another time, she would only lay her face upon his desk, and leave a kiss there, and a tear.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="DS.c23.p10"><s sid="39" id="DS.c23.s39">Still no one knew of this.</s> <s sid="40" id="DS.c23.s40">Unless the household found it out when she was not there--and they all held Mr Dombey's rooms in awe--it was as deep a secret in her breast as what had gone before it.</s> <s sid="41" id="DS.c23.s41">Florence stole into those rooms at twilight, early in the morning, and at times when meals were served downstairs.</s> <s sid="42" id="DS.c23.s42">And although they were in every nook the better and the brighter for her care, she entered and passed out as quietly as any sunbeam, opting that she left her light behind.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="DS.c23.p11"><s sid="43" id="DS.c23.s43">Shadowy company attended Florence up and down the echoing house, and sat with her in the dismantled rooms.</s> <s sid="44" id="DS.c23.s44">As if her life were an enchanted vision, there arose out of her solitude ministering thoughts, that made it fanciful and unreal.</s> <s sid="45" id="DS.c23.s45">She imagined so often what her life would have been if her father could have loved her and she had been a favourite child, that sometimes, for the moment, she almost believed it was so, and, borne on by the current of that pensive fiction, seemed to remember how they had watched her brother in his grave together; how they had freely shared his heart between them; how they were united in the dear remembrance of him; how they often spoke about him yet; and her kind father, looking at her gently, told her of their common hope and trust in God.</s> <s sid="46" id="DS.c23.s46">At other times she pictured to herself her mother yet alive.</s> <s sid="47" id="DS.c23.s47">And oh the happiness of falling on her neck, and clinging to her with the love and confidence of all her soul!</s> <s sid="48" id="DS.c23.s48">And oh the desolation of the solitary house again, with evening coming on, and no one there!</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="DS.c23.p12"><s sid="49" id="DS.c23.s49">But there was one thought, scarcely shaped out to herself, yet fervent and strong within her, that upheld Florence when she strove and filled her true young heart, so sorely tried, with constancy of purpose.</s> <s sid="50" id="DS.c23.s50">Into her mind, as 'into all others contending with the great affliction of our mortal nature, there had stolen solemn wonderings and hopes, arising in the dim world beyond the present life, and murmuring, like faint music, of recognition in the far-off land between her brother and her mother: of some present consciousness in both of her: some love and commiseration for her: and some knowledge of her as she went her way upon the earth.</s> <s sid="51" id="DS.c23.s51">It was a soothing consolation to Florence to give shelter to these thoughts, until one day--it was soon after she had last seen her father in his own room, late at night--the fancy came upon her, that, in weeping for his alienated heart, she might stir the spirits of the dead against him' Wild, weak, childish, as it may have been to think so, and to tremble at the half-formed thought, it was the impulse of her loving nature; and from that hour Florence strove against the cruel wound in her breast, and tried to think of him whose hand had made it, only with hope.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="DS.c23.p13"><s sid="52" id="DS.c23.s52">Her father did not know--she held to it from that time--how much she loved him.</s> <s sid="53" id="DS.c23.s53">She was very young, and had no mother, and had never learned, by some fault or misfortune, how to express to him that she loved him.</s> <s sid="54" id="DS.c23.s54">She would be patient, and would try to gain that art in time, and win him to a better knowledge of his only child.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="DS.c23.p14"><s sid="55" id="DS.c23.s55">This became the purpose of her life.</s> <s sid="56" id="DS.c23.s56">The morning sun shone down upon the faded house, and found the resolution bright and fresh within the bosom of its solitary mistress, Through all the duties of the day, it animated her; for Florence hoped that the more she knew, and the more accomplished she became, the more glad he would be when he came to know and like her.</s> <s sid="57" id="DS.c23.s57">Sometimes she wondered, with a swelling heart and rising tear, whether she was proficient enough in anything to surprise him when they should become companions.</s> <s sid="58" id="DS.c23.s58">Sometimes she tried to think if there were any kind of knowledge that would bespeak his interest more readily than another.</s> <s sid="59" id="DS.c23.s59">Always: at her books, her music, and her work: in her morning walks, and in her nightly prayers: she had her engrossing aim in view.</s> <s sid="60" id="DS.c23.s60">Strange study for a child, to learn the road to a hard parent's heart!</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="DS.c23.p15"><s sid="61" id="DS.c23.s61">There were many careless loungers through the street, as the summer evening deepened into night, who glanced across the road at the sombre house, and saw the youthful figure at the window, such a contrast to it, looking upward at the stars as they began to shine, who would have slept the worse if they had known on what design she mused so steady.</s> <s sid="62" id="DS.c23.s62">The reputation of the mansion as a haunted house, would not have been the gayer with some humble dwellers elsewhere, who were struck by its external gloom in passing and repassing on their daily avocations, and so named it, if they could have read its story in the darkening face.</s> <s sid="63" id="DS.c23.s63">But Florence held her sacred purpose, unsuspected and unaided: and studied only how to bring her father to the understanding that she loved him, and made no appeal against him in any wandering thought.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="DS.c23.p16"><s sid="64" id="DS.c23.s64">Thus Florence lived alone in the deserted house, and day succeeded day, and still she lived alone, and the monotonous walls looked down upon her with a stare, as if they had a Gorgon-like intent to stare her youth and beauty into stone.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c24.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c24.s1">Sir Barnet and Lady Skettles, very good people, resided in a pretty villa at Fulham, on the banks of the Thames; which was one of the most desirable residences in the world when a rowing-match happened to be going past, but had its little inconveniences at other times, among which may be enumerated the occasional appearance of the river in the drawing-room, and the contemporaneous disappearance of the lawn and shrubbery.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c24.p2"><s sid="2" id="DS.c24.s2">Sir Barnet Skettles expressed his personal consequence chiefly through an antique gold snuffbox, and a ponderous silk pocket-kerchief, which he had an imposing manner of drawing out of his pocket like a banner and using with both hands at once.</s> <s sid="3" id="DS.c24.s3">Sir Barnet's object in life was constantly to extend the range of his acquaintance.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c24.s4">Like a heavy body dropped into water--not to disparage so worthy a gentleman by the comparison--it was in the nature of things that Sir Barnet must spread an ever widening circle about him, until there was no room left.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c24.s5">Or, like a sound in air, the vibration of which, according to the speculation of an ingenious modern philosopher, may go on travelling for ever through the interminable fields of space, nothing but coming to the end of his moral tether could stop Sir Barnet Skettles in his voyage of discovery through the social system.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="DS.c24.p10"><s sid="26" id="DS.c24.s26">Sir Barnet was fain, under these circumstances, to content himself for the time with the company assembled.</s> <s sid="27" id="DS.c24.s27">Florence was glad of that; for she had a study to pursue among them, and it lay too near her heart, and was too precious and momentous, to yield to any other interest.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="DS.c25.p40"><s sid="86" id="DS.c25.s86">Dejected and despondent in the extreme, Captain Cuttle felt it just to release Rob from the arrest in which he had placed him, and to enlarge him, subject to a kind of honourable inspection which he still resolved to exercise; and having hired a man, from Brogley the Broker, to sit in the shop during their absence, the Captain, taking Rob with him, issued forth upon a dismal quest after the mortal remains of Solomon Gills.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="DS.c25.p62"><s sid="128" id="DS.c25.s128">Captain Cuttle kept up appearances, nevertheless, tolerably well, and for an hour or two was very hardly used and roughly handled by the young MacStingers: who in their childish frolics, did a little damage also to the glazed hat, by sitting in it, two at a time, as in a nest, and drumming on the inside of the crown with their shoes.</s> <s sid="129" id="DS.c25.s129">At length the Captain sorrowfully dismissed them: taking leave of these cherubs with the poignant remorse and grief of a man who was going to execution.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="DS.c25.p63"><s sid="130" id="DS.c25.s130">In the silence of night, the Captain packed up his heavier property in a chest, which he locked, intending to leave it there, in all probability for ever, but on the forlorn chance of one day finding a man sufficiently bold and desperate to come and ask for it.</s> <s sid="131" id="DS.c25.s131">Of his lighter necessaries, the Captain made a bundle; and disposed his plate about his person, ready for flight.</s> <s sid="132" id="DS.c25.s132">At the hour of midnight, when Brig Place was buried in slumber, and Mrs MacStinger was lulled in sweet oblivion, with her infants around her, the guilty Captain, stealing down on tiptoe, in the dark, opened the door, closed it softly after him, and took to his heels.</s> </p>

<p pid="72" id="DS.c25.p72"><s sid="149" id="DS.c25.s149">Captain Cuttle found time, however, in the midst of this fatiguing service to inspect the stock; in connexion with which he had the general idea (very laborious to Rob) that too much friction could not be bestowed upon it, and that it could not be made too bright.</s> <s sid="150" id="DS.c25.s150">He also ticketed a few attractive-looking articles at a venture, at prices ranging from ten shillings to fifty pounds, and exposed them in the window to the great astonishment of the public.</s> </p>

<p pid="73" id="DS.c25.p73"><s sid="151" id="DS.c25.s151">After effecting these improvements, Captain Cuttle, surrounded by the instruments, began to feel scientific: and looked up at the stars at night, through the skylight, when he was smoking his pipe in the little back parlour before going to bed, as if he had established a kind of property in them.</s> <s sid="152" id="DS.c25.s152">As a tradesman in the City, too, he began to have an interest in the Lord Mayor, and the Sheriffs, and in Public Companies; and felt bound to read the quotations of the Funds every day, though he was unable to make out, on any principle of navigation, what the figures meant, and could have very well dispensed with the fractions.</s> <s sid="153" id="DS.c25.s153">Florence, the Captain waited on, with his strange news of Uncle Sol, immediately after taking possession of the Midshipman; but she was away from home.</s> <s sid="154" id="DS.c25.s154">So the Captain sat himself down in his altered station of life, with no company but Rob the Grinder; and losing count of time, as men do when great changes come upon them, thought musingly of Walter, and of Solomon Gills, and even of Mrs MacStinger herself, as among the things that had been.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c27.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c27.s1">Mr Carker the Manager rose with the lark, and went out, walking in the summer day.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c27.s2">His meditations--and he meditated with contracted brows while he strolled along--hardly seemed to soar as high as the lark, or to mount in that direction; rather they kept close to their nest upon the earth, and looked about, among the dust and worms.</s> <s sid="3" id="DS.c27.s3">But there was not a bird in the air, singing unseen, farther beyond the reach of human eye than Mr Carker's thoughts.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c27.s4">He had his face so perfectly under control, that few could say more, in distinct terms, of its expression, than that it smiled or that it pondered.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c27.s5">It pondered now, intently.</s> <s sid="6" id="DS.c27.s6">As the lark rose higher, he sank deeper in thought.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c27.s7">As the lark poured out her melody clearer and stronger, he fell into a graver and profounder silence.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c27.s8">At length, when the lark came headlong down, with an accumulating stream of song, and dropped among the green wheat near him, rippling in the breath of the morning like a river, he sprang up from his reverie, and looked round with a sudden smile, as courteous and as soft as if he had had numerous observers to propitiate; nor did he relapse, after being thus awakened; but clearing his face, like one who bethought himself that it might otherwise wrinkle and tell tales, went smiling on, as if for practice.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c27.p2"><s sid="9" id="DS.c27.s9">Perhaps with an eye to first impressions, Mr Carker was very carefully and trimly dressed, that morning.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c27.s10">Though always somewhat formal, in his dress, in imitation of the great man whom he served, he stopped short of the extent of Mr Dombey's stiffness: at once perhaps because he knew it to be ludicrous, and because in doing so he found another means of expressing his sense of the difference and distance between them.</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c27.s11">Some people quoted him indeed, in this respect, as a pointed commentary, and not a flattering one, on his icy patron--but the world is prone to misconstruction, and Mr Carker was not accountable for its bad propensity.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c27.p5"><s sid="18" id="DS.c27.s18">But he found he was mistaken in supposing there was no one in the grove, for as he softly rounded the trunk of one large tree, on which the obdurate bark was knotted and overlapped like the hide of a rhinoceros or some kindred monster of the ancient days before the Flood, he saw an unexpected figure sitting on a bench near at hand, about which, in another moment, he would have wound the chain he was making.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DS.c27.p6"><s sid="19" id="DS.c27.s19">It was that of a lady, elegantly dressed and very handsome, whose dark proud eyes were fixed upon the ground, and in whom some passion or struggle was raging.</s> <s sid="20" id="DS.c27.s20">For as she sat looking down, she held a corner of her under lip within her mouth, her bosom heaved, her nostril quivered, her head trembled, indignant tears were on her cheek, and her foot was set upon the moss as though she would have crushed it into nothing.</s> <s sid="21" id="DS.c27.s21">And yet almost the self-same glance that showed him this, showed him the self-same lady rising with a scornful air of weariness and lassitude, and turning away with nothing expressed in face or figure but careless beauty and imperious disdain.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 29. The Opening of the Eyes of Mrs Chick</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c29.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c29.s1">Miss Tox, all unconscious of any such rare appearances in connexion with Mr Dombey's house, as scaffoldings and ladders, and men with their heads tied up in pocket-handkerchiefs, glaring in at the windows like flying genii or strange birds,--having breakfasted one morning at about this eventful period of time, on her customary viands; to wit, one French roll rasped, one egg new laid (or warranted to be), and one little pot of tea, wherein was infused one little silver scoopful of that herb on behalf of Miss Tox, and one little silver scoopful on behalf of the teapot--a flight of fancy in which good housekeepers delight; went upstairs to set forth the bird waltz on the harpsichord, to water and arrange the plants, to dust the nick-nacks, and, according to her daily custom, to make her little drawing-room the garland of Princess's Place.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c29.p2"><s sid="2" id="DS.c29.s2">Miss Tox endued herself with a pair of ancient gloves, like dead leaves, in which she was accustomed to perform these avocations--hidden from human sight at other times in a table drawer--and went methodically to work; beginning with the bird waltz; passing, by a natural association of ideas, to her bird--a very high-shouldered canary, stricken in years, and much rumpled, but a piercing singer, as Princess's Place well knew; taking, next in order, the little china ornaments, paper fly-cages, and so forth; and coming round, in good time, to the plants, which generally required to be snipped here and there with a pair of scissors, for some botanical reason that was very powerful with Miss Tox.</s> <s sid="3" id="DS.c29.s3">Miss Tox was slow in coming to the plants, this morning.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c29.s4">The weather was warm, the wind southerly; and there was a sigh of the summer-time In Princess's Place, that turned Miss Tox's thoughts upon the country.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c29.s5">The pot-boy attached to the Princess's Arms had come out with a can and trickled water, in a flowering pattern, all over Princess's Place, and it gave the weedy ground a fresh scent--quite a growing scent, Miss Tox said.</s> <s sid="6" id="DS.c29.s6">There was a tiny blink of sun peeping in from the great street round the corner, and the smoky sparrows hopped over it and back again, brightening as they passed: or bathed in it, like a stream, and became glorified sparrows, unconnected with chimneys.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c29.s7">Legends in praise of Ginger-Beer, with pictorial representations of thirsty customers submerged in the effervescence, or stunned by the flying corks, were conspicuous in the window of the Princess's Arms.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c29.s8">They were making late hay, somewhere out of town; and though the fragrance had a long way to come, and many counter fragrances to contend with among the dwellings of the poor (may God reward the worthy gentlemen who stickle for the Plague as part and parcel of the wisdom of our ancestors, and who do their little best to keep those dwellings miserable!), yet it was wafted faintly into Princess's Place, whispering of Nature and her wholesome air, as such things will, even unto prisoners and captives, and those who are desolate and oppressed, in very spite of aldermen and knights to boot: at whose sage nod--and how they nod!--the rolling world stands still!</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c29.p3"><s sid="9" id="DS.c29.s9">Miss Tox sat down upon the window-seat, and thought of her good Papa deceased--Mr Tox, of the Customs Department of the public service; and of her childhood, passed at a seaport, among a considerable quantity of cold tar, and some rusticity.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c29.s10">She fell into a softened remembrance of meadows, in old time, gleaming with buttercups, like so many inverted firmaments of golden stars; and how she had made chains of dandelion-stalks for youthful vowers of eternal constancy, dressed chiefly in nankeen; and how soon those fetters had withered and broken.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c29.p4"><s sid="11" id="DS.c29.s11">Sitting on the window-seat, and looking out upon the sparrows and the blink of sun, Miss Tox thought likewise of her good Mama deceased--sister to the owner of the powdered head and pigtail--of her virtues and her rheumatism.</s> <s sid="12" id="DS.c29.s12">And when a man with bulgy legs, and a rough voice, and a heavy basket on his head that crushed his hat into a mere black muffin, came crying flowers down Princess's Place, making his timid little roots of daisies shudder in the vibration of every yell he gave, as though he had been an ogre, hawking little children, summer recollections were so strong upon Miss Tox, that she shook her head, and murmured she would be comparatively old before she knew it--which seemed likely.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c29.p5"><s sid="13" id="DS.c29.s13">In her pensive mood, Miss Tox's thoughts went wandering on Mr Dombey's track; probably because the Major had returned home to his lodgings opposite, and had just bowed to her from his window.</s> <s sid="14" id="DS.c29.s14">What other reason could Miss Tox have for connecting Mr Dombey with her summer days and dandelion fetters?</s> <s sid="15" id="DS.c29.s15">Was he more cheerful? thought Miss Tox.</s> <s sid="16" id="DS.c29.s16">Was he reconciled to the decrees of fate?</s> <s sid="17" id="DS.c29.s17">Would he ever marry again? and if yes, whom?</s> <s sid="18" id="DS.c29.s18">What sort of person now!</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DS.c29.p6"><s sid="19" id="DS.c29.s19">A flush--it was warm weather--overspread Miss Tox's face, as, while entertaining these meditations, she turned her head, and was surprised by the reflection of her thoughtful image In the chimney-glass.</s> <s sid="20" id="DS.c29.s20">Another flush succeeded when she saw a little carriage drive into Princess's Place, and make straight for her own door.</s> <s sid="21" id="DS.c29.s21">Miss Tox arose, took up her scissors hastily, and so coming, at last, to the plants, was very busy with them when Mrs Chick entered the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c30.p3"><s sid="8" id="DS.c30.s8">In her thoughts of her new mother, and in the love and trust overflowing her pure heart towards her, Florence loved her own dead mother more and more.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c30.s9">She had no fear of setting up a rival in her breast.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c30.s10">The new flower sprang from the deep-planted and long-cherished root, she knew.</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c30.s11">Every gentle word that had fallen from the lips of the beautiful lady, sounded to Florence like an echo of the voice long hushed and silent.</s> <s sid="12" id="DS.c30.s12">How could she love that memory less for living tenderness, when it was her memory of all parental tenderness and love!</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c30.p4"><s sid="13" id="DS.c30.s13">Florence was, one day, sitting reading in her room, and thinking of the lady and her promised visit soon--for her book turned on a kindred subject--when, raising her eyes, she saw her standing in the doorway.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="DS.c30.p32"><s sid="67" id="DS.c30.s67">Was this the woman whom Florence--an innocent girl, strong only in her earnestness and simple truth--could so impress and quell, that by her side she was another creature, with her tempest of passion hushed, and her very pride itself subdued?</s> <s sid="68" id="DS.c30.s68">Was this the woman who now sat beside her in a carriage, with her arms entwined, and who, while she courted and entreated her to love and trust her, drew her fair head to nestle on her breast, and would have laid down life to shield it from wrong or harm?</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="DS.c30.p34"><s sid="71" id="DS.c30.s71">The Honourable Mrs Skewton, who was thinking of anything rather than of such sentiments--for, like many genteel persons who have existed at various times, she set her face against death altogether, and objected to the mention of any such low and levelling upstart--had borrowed a house in Brook Street, Grosvenor Square, from a stately relative (one of the Feenix brood), who was out of town, and who did not object to lending it, in the handsomest manner, for nuptial purposes, as the loan implied his final release and acquittance from all further loans and gifts to Mrs Skewton and her daughter.</s> <s sid="72" id="DS.c30.s72">It being necessary for the credit of the family to make a handsome appearance at such a time, Mrs Skewton, with the assistance of an accommodating tradesman resident In the parish of Mary-le-bone, who lent out all sorts of articles to the nobility and gentry, from a service of plate to an army of footmen, clapped into this house a silver-headed butler (who was charged extra on that account, as having the appearance of an ancient family retainer), two very tall young men in livery, and a select staff of kitchen-servants; so that a legend arose, downstairs, that Withers the page, released at once from his numerous household duties, and from the propulsion of the wheeled-chair (inconsistent with the metropolis), had been several times observed to rub his eyes and pinch his limbs, as if he misdoubted his having overslept himself at the Leamington milkman's, and being still in a celestial dream.</s> <s sid="73" id="DS.c30.s73">A variety of requisites in plate and china being also conveyed to the same establishment from the same convenient source, with several miscellaneous articles, including a neat chariot and a pair of bays, Mrs Skewton cushioned herself on the principal sofa, in the Cleopatra attitude, and held her court in fair state.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c31.p3"><s sid="8" id="DS.c31.s8">And now, the mice, who have been busier with the prayer-books than their proper owners, and with the hassocks, more worn by their little teeth than by human knees, hide their bright eyes in their holes, and gather close together in affright at the resounding clashing of the church-door.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c31.s9">For the beadle, that man of power, comes early this morning with the sexton; and Mrs Miff, the wheezy little pew-opener--a mighty dry old lady, sparely dressed, with not an inch of fulness anywhere about her--is also here, and has been waiting at the church-gate half-an-hour, as her place is, for the beadle.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c31.p4"><s sid="10" id="DS.c31.s10">A vinegary face has Mrs Miff, and a mortified bonnet, and eke a thirsty soul for sixpences and shillings.</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c31.s11">Beckoning to stray people to come into pews, has given Mrs Miff an air of mystery; and there is reservation in the eye of Mrs Miff, as always knowing of a softer seat, but having her suspicions of the fee.</s> <s sid="12" id="DS.c31.s12">There is no such fact as Mr Miff, nor has there been, these twenty years, and Mrs Miff would rather not allude to him.</s> <s sid="13" id="DS.c31.s13">He held some bad opinions, it would seem, about free seats; and though Mrs Miff hopes he may be gone upwards, she couldn't positively undertake to say so.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c34.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c34.s1">In an ugly and dark room, an old woman, ugly and dark too, sat listening to the wind and rain, and crouching over a meagre fire.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c34.s2">More constant to the last-named occupation than the first, she never changed her attitude, unless, when any stray drops of rain fell hissing on the smouldering embers, to raise her head with an awakened attention to the whistling and pattering outside, and gradually to let it fall again lower and lower and lower as she sunk into a brooding state of thought, in which the noises of the night were as indistinctly regarded as is the monotonous rolling of a sea by one who sits in contemplation on its shore.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 36. Housewarming</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c36.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c36.s1">Many succeeding days passed in like manner; except that there were numerous visits received and paid, and that Mrs Skewton held little levees in her own apartments, at which Major Bagstock was a frequent attendant, and that Florence encountered no second look from her father, although she saw him every day.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c36.s2">Nor had she much communication in words with her new Mama, who was imperious and proud to all the house but her--Florence could not but observe that--and who, although she always sent for her or went to her when she came home from visiting, and would always go into her room at night, before retiring to rest, however late the hour, and never lost an opportunity of being with her, was often her silent and thoughtful companion for a long time together.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c36.p2"><s sid="3" id="DS.c36.s3">Florence, who had hoped for so much from this marriage, could not help sometimes comparing the bright house with the faded dreary place out of which it had arisen, and wondering when, in any shape, it would begin to be a home; for that it was no home then, for anyone, though everything went on luxuriously and regularly, she had always a secret misgiving.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c36.s4">Many an hour of sorrowful reflection by day and night, and many a tear of blighted hope, Florence bestowed upon the assurance her new Mama had given her so strongly, that there was no one on the earth more powerless than herself to teach her how to win her father's heart.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c36.s5">And soon Florence began to think--resolved to think would be the truer phrase--that as no one knew so well, how hopeless of being subdued or changed her father's coldness to her was, so she had given her this warning, and forbidden the subject in very compassion.</s> <s sid="6" id="DS.c36.s6">Unselfish here, as in her every act and fancy, Florence preferred to bear the pain of this new wound, rather than encourage any faint foreshadowings of the truth as it concerned her father; tender of him, even in her wandering thoughts.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c36.s7">As for his home, she hoped it would become a better one, when its state of novelty and transition should be over; and for herself, thought little and lamented less.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c36.p3"><s sid="8" id="DS.c36.s8">If none of the new family were particularly at home in private, it was resolved that Mrs Dombey at least should be at home in public, without delay.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c36.s9">A series of entertainments in celebration of the late nuptials, and in cultivation of society, were arranged, chiefly by Mr Dombey and Mrs Skewton; and it was settled that the festive proceedings should commence by Mrs Dombey's being at home upon a certain evening, and by Mr and Mrs Dombey's requesting the honour of the company of a great many incongruous people to dinner on the same day.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c36.p4"><s sid="10" id="DS.c36.s10">Accordingly, Mr Dombey produced a list of sundry eastern magnates who were to be bidden to this feast on his behalf; to which Mrs Skewton, acting for her dearest child, who was haughtily careless on the subject, subjoined a western list, comprising Cousin Feenix, not yet returned to Baden-Baden, greatly to the detriment of his personal estate; and a variety of moths of various degrees and ages, who had, at various times, fluttered round the light of her fair daughter, or herself, without any lasting injury to their wings.</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c36.s11">Florence was enrolled as a member of the dinner-party, by Edith's command--elicited by a moment's doubt and hesitation on the part of Mrs Skewton; and Florence, with a wondering heart, and with a quick instinctive sense of everything that grated on her father in the least, took her silent share in the proceedings of the day.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c36.p5"><s sid="12" id="DS.c36.s12">The proceedings commenced by Mr Dombey, in a cravat of extraordinary height and stiffness, walking restlessly about the drawing-room until the hour appointed for dinner; punctual to which, an East India Director,' of immense wealth, in a waistcoat apparently constructed in serviceable deal by some plain carpenter, but really engendered in the tailor's art, and composed of the material called nankeen, arrived and was received by Mr Dombey alone.</s> <s sid="13" id="DS.c36.s13">The next stage of the proceedings was Mr Dombey's sending his compliments to Mrs Dombey, with a correct statement of the time; and the next, the East India Director's falling prostrate, in a conversational point of view, and as Mr Dombey was not the man to pick him up, staring at the fire until rescue appeared in the shape of Mrs Skewton; whom the director, as a pleasant start in life for the evening, mistook for Mrs Dombey, and greeted with enthusiasm.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DS.c36.p6"><s sid="14" id="DS.c36.s14">The next arrival was a Bank Director, reputed to be able to buy up anything--human Nature generally, if he should take it in his head to influence the money market in that direction--but who was a wonderfully modest-spoken man, almost boastfully so, and mentioned his 'little place' at Kingston-upon-Thames, and its just being barely equal to giving Dombey a bed and a chop, if he would come and visit it.</s> <s sid="15" id="DS.c36.s15">Ladies, he said, it was not for a man who lived in his quiet way to take upon himself to invite--but if Mrs Skewton and her daughter, Mrs Dombey, should ever find themselves in that direction, and would do him the honour to look at a little bit of a shrubbery they would find there, and a poor little flower-bed or so, and a humble apology for a pinery, and two or three little attempts of that sort without any pretension, they would distinguish him very much.</s> <s sid="16" id="DS.c36.s16">Carrying out his character, this gentleman was very plainly dressed, in a wisp of cambric for a neckcloth, big shoes, a coat that was too loose for him, and a pair of trousers that were too spare; and mention being made of the Opera by Mrs Skewton, he said he very seldom went there, for he couldn't afford it.</s> <s sid="17" id="DS.c36.s17">It seemed greatly to delight and exhilarate him to say so: and he beamed on his audience afterwards, with his hands in his pockets, and excessive satisfaction twinkling in his eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DS.c36.p7"><s sid="18" id="DS.c36.s18">Now Mrs Dombey appeared, beautiful and proud, and as disdainful and defiant of them all as if the bridal wreath upon her head had been a garland of steel spikes put on to force concession from her which she would die sooner than yield.</s> <s sid="19" id="DS.c36.s19">With her was Florence.</s> <s sid="20" id="DS.c36.s20">When they entered together, the shadow of the night of the return again darkened Mr Dombey's face.</s> <s sid="21" id="DS.c36.s21">But unobserved; for Florence did not venture to raise her eyes to his, and Edith's indifference was too supreme to take the least heed of him.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="DS.c36.p8"><s sid="22" id="DS.c36.s22">The arrivals quickly became numerous.</s> <s sid="23" id="DS.c36.s23">More directors, chairmen of public companies, elderly ladies carrying burdens on their heads for full dress, Cousin Feenix, Major Bagstock, friends of Mrs Skewton, with the same bright bloom on their complexion, and very precious necklaces on very withered necks.</s> <s sid="24" id="DS.c36.s24">Among these, a young lady of sixty-five, remarkably coolly dressed as to her back and shoulders, who spoke with an engaging lisp, and whose eyelids wouldn't keep up well, without a great deal of trouble on her part, and whose manners had that indefinable charm which so frequently attaches to the giddiness of youth.</s> <s sid="25" id="DS.c36.s25">As the greater part of Mr Dombey's list were disposed to be taciturn, and the greater part of Mrs Dombey's list were disposed to be talkative, and there was no sympathy between them, Mrs Dombey's list, by magnetic agreement, entered into a bond of union against Mr Dombey's list, who, wandering about the rooms in a desolate manner, or seeking refuge in corners, entangled themselves with company coming in, and became barricaded behind sofas, and had doors opened smartly from without against their heads, and underwent every sort of discomfiture.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="DS.c36.p9"><s sid="26" id="DS.c36.s26">When dinner was announced, Mr Dombey took down an old lady like a crimson velvet pincushion stuffed with bank notes, who might have been the identical old lady of Threadneedle Street, she was so rich, and looked so unaccommodating; Cousin Feenix took down Mrs Dombey; Major Bagstock took down Mrs Skewton; the young thing with the shoulders was bestowed, as an extinguisher, upon the East India Director; and the remaining ladies were left on view in the drawing-room by the remaining gentlemen, until a forlorn hope volunteered to conduct them downstairs, and those brave spirits with their captives blocked up the dining-room door, shutting out seven mild men in the stony-hearted hall.</s> <s sid="27" id="DS.c36.s27">When all the rest were got in and were seated, one of these mild men still appeared, in smiling confusion, totally destitute and unprovided for, and, escorted by the butler, made the complete circuit of the table twice before his chair could be found, which it finally was, on Mrs Dombey's left hand; after which the mild man never held up his head again.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="DS.c36.p10"><s sid="28" id="DS.c36.s28">Now, the spacious dining-room, with the company seated round the glittering table, busy with their glittering spoons, and knives and forks, and plates, might have been taken for a grown-up exposition of Tom Tiddler's ground, where children pick up gold and silver.'</s> <s sid="29" id="DS.c36.s29">Mr Dombey, as Tiddler, looked his character to admiration; and the long plateau of precious metal frosted, separating him from Mrs Dombey, whereon frosted Cupids offered scentless flowers to each of them, was allegorical to see.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 39. Further Adventures of Captain Edward Cuttle, Mariner</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c39.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c39.s1">Time, sure of foot and strong of will, had so pressed onward, that the year enjoined by the old Instrument-maker, as the term during which his friend should refrain from opening the sealed packet accompanying the letter he had left for him, was now nearly expired, and Captain Cuttle began to look at it, of an evening, with feelings of mystery and uneasiness.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c39.p2"><s sid="2" id="DS.c39.s2">The Captain, in his honour, would as soon have thought of opening the parcel one hour before the expiration of the term, as he would have thought of opening himself, to study his own anatomy.</s> <s sid="3" id="DS.c39.s3">He merely brought it out, at a certain stage of his first evening pipe, laid it on the table, and sat gazing at the outside of it, through the smoke, in silent gravity, for two or three hours at a spell.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c39.s4">Sometimes, when he had contemplated it thus for a pretty long while, the Captain would hitch his chair, by degrees, farther and farther off, as if to get beyond the range of its fascination; but if this were his design, he never succeeded: for even when he was brought up by the parlour wall, the packet still attracted him; or if his eyes, in thoughtful wandering, roved to the ceiling or the fire, its image immediately followed, and posted itself conspicuously among the coals, or took up an advantageous position on the whitewash.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c39.p3"><s sid="5" id="DS.c39.s5">In respect of Heart's Delight, the Captain's parental and admiration knew no change.</s> <s sid="6" id="DS.c39.s6">But since his last interview with Mr Carker, Captain Cuttle had come to entertain doubts whether his former intervention in behalf of that young lady and his dear boy Wal'r, had proved altogether so favourable as he could have wished, and as he at the time believed.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c39.s7">The Captain was troubled with a serious misgiving that he had done more harm than good, in short; and in his remorse and modesty he made the best atonement he could think of, by putting himself out of the way of doing any harm to anyone, and, as it were, throwing himself overboard for a dangerous person.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c39.p4"><s sid="8" id="DS.c39.s8">Self-buried, therefore, among the instruments, the Captain never went near Mr Dombey's house, or reported himself in any way to Florence or Miss Nipper.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c39.s9">He even severed himself from Mr Perch, on the occasion of his next visit, by dryly informing that gentleman, that he thanked him for his company, but had cut himself adrift from all such acquaintance, as he didn't know what magazine he mightn't blow up, without meaning of it.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c39.s10">In this self-imposed retirement, the Captain passed whole days and weeks without interchanging a word with anyone but Rob the Grinder, whom he esteemed as a pattern of disinterested attachment and fidelity.</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c39.s11">In this retirement, the Captain, gazing at the packet of an evening, would sit smoking, and thinking of Florence and poor Walter, until they both seemed to his homely fancy to be dead, and to have passed away into eternal youth, the beautiful and innocent children of his first remembrance.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c39.p5"><s sid="12" id="DS.c39.s12">The Captain did not, however, in his musings, neglect his own improvement, or the mental culture of Rob the Grinder.</s> <s sid="13" id="DS.c39.s13">That young man was generally required to read out of some book to the Captain, for one hour, every evening; and as the Captain implicitly believed that all books were true, he accumulated, by this means, many remarkable facts.</s> <s sid="14" id="DS.c39.s14">On Sunday nights, the Captain always read for himself, before going to bed, a certain Divine Sermon once delivered on a Mount; and although he was accustomed to quote the text, without book, after his own manner, he appeared to read it with as reverent an understanding of its heavenly spirit, as if he had got it all by heart in Greek, and had been able to write any number of fierce theological disquisitions on its every phrase.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DS.c39.p6"><s sid="15" id="DS.c39.s15">Rob the Grinder, whose reverence for the inspired writings, under the admirable system of the Grinders' School, had been developed by a perpetual bruising of his intellectual shins against all the proper names of all the tribes of Judah, and by the monotonous repetition of hard verses, especially by way of punishment, and by the parading of him at six years old in leather breeches, three times a Sunday, very high up, in a very hot church, with a great organ buzzing against his drowsy head, like an exceedingly busy bee--Rob the Grinder made a mighty show of being edified when the Captain ceased to read, and generally yawned and nodded while the reading was in progress.</s> <s sid="16" id="DS.c39.s16">The latter fact being never so much as suspected by the good Captain.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c42.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c42.s1">Attired no more in Captain Cuttle's sable slops and sou'-wester hat, but dressed in a substantial suit of brown livery, which, while it affected to be a very sober and demure livery indeed, was really as self-satisfied and confident a one as tailor need desire to make, Rob the Grinder, thus transformed as to his outer man, and all regardless within of the Captain and the Midshipman, except when he devoted a few minutes of his leisure time to crowing over those inseparable worthies, and recalling, with much applauding music from that brazen instrument, his conscience, the triumphant manner in which he had disembarrassed himself of their company, now served his patron, Mr Carker.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c42.s2">Inmate of Mr Carker's house, and serving about his person, Rob kept his round eyes on the white teeth with fear and trembling, and felt that he had need to open them wider than ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c42.p2"><s sid="3" id="DS.c42.s3">He could not have quaked more, through his whole being, before the teeth, though he had come into the service of some powerful enchanter, and they had been his strongest spells.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c42.s4">The boy had a sense of power and authority in this patron of his that engrossed his whole attention and exacted his most implicit submission and obedience.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c42.s5">He hardly considered himself safe in thinking about him when he was absent, lest he should feel himself immediately taken by the throat again, as on the morning when he first became bound to him, and should see every one of the teeth finding him out, and taxing him with every fancy of his mind.</s> <s sid="6" id="DS.c42.s6">Face to face with him, Rob had no more doubt that Mr Carker read his secret thoughts, or that he could read them by the least exertion of his will if he were so inclined, than he had that Mr Carker saw him when he looked at him.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c42.s7">The ascendancy was so complete, and held him in such enthralment, that, hardly daring to think at all, but with his mind filled with a constantly dilating impression of his patron's irresistible command over him, and power of doing anything with him, he would stand watching his pleasure, and trying to anticipate his orders, in a state of mental suspension, as to all other things.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c42.p3"><s sid="8" id="DS.c42.s8">Rob had not informed himself perhaps--in his then state of mind it would have been an act of no common temerity to inquire--whether he yielded so completely to this influence in any part, because he had floating suspicions of his patron's being a master of certain treacherous arts in which he had himself been a poor scholar at the Grinders' School.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c42.s9">But certainly Rob admired him, as well as feared him.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c42.s10">Mr Carker, perhaps, was better acquainted with the sources of his power, which lost nothing by his management of it.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 43. The Watches of the Night</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c43.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c43.s1">Florence, long since awakened from her dream, mournfully observed the estrangement between her father and Edith, and saw it widen more and more, and knew that there was greater bitterness between them every day.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c43.s2">Each day's added knowledge deepened the shade upon her love and hope, roused up the old sorrow that had slumbered for a little time, and made it even heavier to bear than it had been before.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c43.p2"><s sid="3" id="DS.c43.s3">It had been hard--how hard may none but Florence ever know!--to have the natural affection of a true and earnest nature turned to agony; and slight, or stern repulse, substituted for the tenderest protection and the dearest care.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c43.s4">It had been hard to feel in her deep heart what she had felt, and never know the happiness of one touch of response.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c43.s5">But it was much more hard to be compelled to doubt either her father or Edith, so affectionate and dear to her, and to think of her love for each of them, by turns, with fear, distrust, and wonder.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c43.p3"><s sid="6" id="DS.c43.s6">Yet Florence now began to do so; and the doing of it was a task imposed upon her by the very purity of her soul, as one she could not fly from.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c43.s7">She saw her father cold and obdurate to Edith, as to her; hard, inflexible, unyielding.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c43.s8">Could it be, she asked herself with starting tears, that her own dear mother had been made unhappy by such treatment, and had pined away and died?</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c43.s9">Then she would think how proud and stately Edith was to everyone but her, with what disdain she treated him, how distantly she kept apart from him, and what she had said on the night when they came home; and quickly it would come on Florence, almost as a crime, that she loved one who was set in opposition to her father, and that her father knowing of it, must think of her in his solitary room as the unnatural child who added this wrong to the old fault, so much wept for, of never having won his fatherly affection from her birth.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c43.s10">The next kind word from Edith, the next kind glance, would shake these thoughts again, and make them seem like black ingratitude; for who but she had cheered the drooping heart of Florence, so lonely and so hurt, and been its best of comforters!</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c43.s11">Thus, with her gentle nature yearning to them both, feeling for the misery of both, and whispering doubts of her own duty to both, Florence in her wider and expanded love, and by the side of Edith, endured more than when she had hoarded up her undivided secret in the mournful house, and her beautiful Mama had never dawned upon it.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c43.p4"><s sid="12" id="DS.c43.s12">One exquisite unhappiness that would have far outweighed this, Florence was spared.</s> <s sid="13" id="DS.c43.s13">She never had the least suspicion that Edith by her tenderness for her widened the separation from her father, or gave him new cause of dislike.</s> <s sid="14" id="DS.c43.s14">If Florence had conceived the possibility of such an effect being wrought by such a cause, what grief she would have felt, what sacrifice she would have tried to make, poor loving girl, how fast and sure her quiet passage might have been beneath it to the presence of that higher Father who does not reject his children's love, or spurn their tried and broken hearts, Heaven knows!</s> <s sid="15" id="DS.c43.s15">But it was otherwise, and that was well.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 46. Recognizant and Reflective</title>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c46.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c46.s1">Among sundry minor alterations in Mr Carker's life and habits that began to take place at this time, none was more remarkable than the extraordinary diligence with which he applied himself to business, and the closeness with which he investigated every detail that the affairs of the House laid open to him.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c46.s2">Always active and penetrating in such matters, his lynx-eyed vigilance now increased twenty-fold.</s> <s sid="3" id="DS.c46.s3">Not only did his weary watch keep pace with every present point that every day presented to him in some new form, but in the midst of these engrossing occupations he found leisure--that is, he made it--to review the past transactions of the Firm, and his share in them, during a long series of years.</s> <s sid="4" id="DS.c46.s4">Frequently when the clerks were all gone, the offices dark and empty, and all similar places of business shut up, Mr Carker, with the whole anatomy of the iron room laid bare before him, would explore the mysteries of books and papers, with the patient progress of a man who was dissecting the minutest nerves and fibres of his subject.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c46.s5">Perch, the messenger, who usually remained on these occasions, to entertain himself with the perusal of the Price Current by the light of one candle, or to doze over the fire in the outer office, at the imminent risk every moment of diving head foremost into the coal-box, could not withhold the tribute of his admiration from this zealous conduct, although it much contracted his domestic enjoyments; and again, and again, expatiated to Mrs Perch (now nursing twins) on the industry and acuteness of their managing gentleman in the City.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c46.p2"><s sid="6" id="DS.c46.s6">The same increased and sharp attention that Mr Carker bestowed on the business of the House, he applied to his own personal affairs.</s> <s sid="7" id="DS.c46.s7">Though not a partner in the concern--a distinction hitherto reserved solely to inheritors of the great name of Dombey--he was in the receipt of some percentage on its dealings; and, participating in all its facilities for the employment of money to advantage, was considered, by the minnows among the tritons of the East, a rich man.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c46.s8">It began to be said, among these shrewd observers, that Jem Carker, of Dombey's, was looking about him to see what he was worth; and that he was calling in his money at a good time, like the long-headed fellow he was; and bets were even offered on the Stock Exchange that Jem was going to marry a rich widow.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c46.p3"><s sid="9" id="DS.c46.s9">Yet these cares did not in the least interfere with Mr Carker's watching of his chief, or with his cleanness, neatness, sleekness, or any cat-like quality he possessed.</s> <s sid="10" id="DS.c46.s10">It was not so much that there was a change in him, in reference to any of his habits, as that the whole man was intensified.</s> <s sid="11" id="DS.c46.s11">Everything that had been observable in him before, was observable now, but with a greater amount of concentration.</s> <s sid="12" id="DS.c46.s12">He did each single thing, as if he did nothing else--a pretty certain indication in a man of that range of ability and purpose, that he is doing something which sharpens and keeps alive his keenest powers.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DS.c46.p4"><s sid="13" id="DS.c46.s13">The only decided alteration in him was, that as he rode to and fro along the streets, he would fall into deep fits of musing, like that in which he had come away from Mr Dombey's house, on the morning of that gentleman's disaster.</s> <s sid="14" id="DS.c46.s14">At such times, he would keep clear of the obstacles in his way, mechanically; and would appear to see and hear nothing until arrival at his destination, or some sudden chance or effort roused him.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DS.c46.p5"><s sid="15" id="DS.c46.s15">Walking his white-legged horse thus, to the counting-house of Dombey and Son one day, he was as unconscious of the observation of two pairs of women's eyes, as of the fascinated orbs of Rob the Grinder, who, in waiting a street's length from the appointed place, as a demonstration of punctuality, vainly touched and retouched his hat to attract attention, and trotted along on foot, by his master's side, prepared to hold his stirrup when he should alight.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DS.c52.p1"><s sid="1" id="DS.c52.s1">Good Mrs Brown and her daughter Alice kept silent company together, in their own dwelling.</s> <s sid="2" id="DS.c52.s2">It was early in the evening, and late in the spring.</s> <s sid="3" id="DS.c52.s3">But a few days had elapsed since Mr Dombey had told Major Bagstock of his singular intelligence, singularly obtained, which might turn out to be valueless, and might turn out to be true; and the world was not satisfied yet.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DS.c52.p2"><s sid="4" id="DS.c52.s4">The mother and daughter sat for a long time without interchanging a word: almost without motion.</s> <s sid="5" id="DS.c52.s5">The old woman's face was shrewdly anxious and expectant; that of her daughter was expectant too, but in a less sharp degree, and sometimes it darkened, as if with gathering disappointment and incredulity.</s> <s sid="6" id="DS.c52.s6">The old woman, without heeding these changes in its expression, though her eyes were often turned towards it, sat mumbling and munching, and listening confidently.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DS.c52.p3"><s sid="7" id="DS.c52.s7">Their abode, though poor and miserable, was not so utterly wretched as in the days when only Good Mrs Brown inhabited it.</s> <s sid="8" id="DS.c52.s8">Some few attempts at cleanliness and order were manifest, though made in a reckless, gipsy way, that might have connected them, at a glance, with the younger woman.</s> <s sid="9" id="DS.c52.s9">The shades of evening thickened and deepened as the two kept silence, until the blackened walls were nearly lost in the prevailing gloom.</s> </p>

<p pid="98" id="DS.c56.p98"><s sid="248" id="DS.c56.s248">These proceedings on the part of Mr Toots, and the strong individual consciousness of them that was exhibited by the Captain, rendered Miss Nipper's position so responsible a one, that she was mightily relieved by the conclusion of the service; and was hardly so affable to Mr Toots as usual, when he informed her and the Captain, on the way back, that now he was sure he had no hope, you know, he felt more comfortable--at least not exactly more comfortable, but more comfortably and completely miserable.</s> </p>
