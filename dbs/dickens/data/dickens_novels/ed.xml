<p pid="19" id="ED.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="ED.c1.s67">There has been chattering and clattering enough between them, but to no purpose.</s> <s sid="68" id="ED.c1.s68">When any distinct word has been flung into the air, it has had no sense or sequence.</s> <s sid="69" id="ED.c1.s69">Wherefore <qs/>'unintelligible!'<qe/> is again the comment of the watcher, made with some reassured nodding of his head, and a gloomy smile.</s> <s sid="70" id="ED.c1.s70">He then lays certain silver money on the table, finds his hat, gropes his way down the broken stairs, gives a good morning to some rat-ridden doorkeeper, in bed in a black hutch beneath the stairs, and passes out.</s> </p><p pid="20" id="ED.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="ED.c1.s71">That same afternoon, the massive gray square tower of an old Cathedral rises before the sight of a jaded traveller.</s> <s sid="72" id="ED.c1.s72">The bells are going for daily vesper service, and he must needs attend it, one would say, from his haste to reach the open Cathedral door.</s> <s sid="73" id="ED.c1.s73">The choir are getting on their sullied white robes, in a hurry, when he arrives among them, gets on his own robe, and falls into the procession filing in to service.</s> <s sid="74" id="ED.c1.s74">Then, the Sacristan locks the iron-barred gates that divide the sanctuary from the chancel, and all of the procession having scuttled into their places, hide their faces; and then the intoned words, <qs/>'WHEN THE WICKED MAN--'<qe/> rise among groins of arches and beams of roof, awakening muttered thunder.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="ED.c6.p1"><s sid="1" id="ED.c6.s1">The Reverend Septimus Crisparkle (Septimus, because six little brother Crisparkles before him went out, one by one, as they were born, like six weak little rushlights, as they were lighted), having broken the thin morning ice near Cloisterham Weir with his amiable head, much to the invigoration of his frame, was now assisting his circulation by boxing at a looking-glass with great science and prowess.</s> <s sid="2" id="ED.c6.s2">A fresh and healthy portrait the looking- glass presented of the Reverend Septimus, feinting and dodging with the utmost artfulness, and hitting out from the shoulder with the utmost straightness, while his radiant features teemed with innocence, and soft-hearted benevolence beamed from his boxing- gloves.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ED.c6.p2"><s sid="3" id="ED.c6.s3">It was scarcely breakfast-time yet, for Mrs. Crisparkle--mother, not wife of the Reverend Septimus--was only just down, and waiting for the urn.</s> <s sid="4" id="ED.c6.s4">Indeed, the Reverend Septimus left off at this very moment to take the pretty old lady's entering face between his boxing-gloves and kiss it.</s> <s sid="5" id="ED.c6.s5">Having done so with tenderness, the Reverend Septimus turned to again, countering with his left, and putting in his right, in a tremendous manner.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ED.c6.p3" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="ED.c6.s6"><qs/>'I say, every morning of my life, that you'll do it at last, Sept,'<qe/><sls/> remarked the old lady, looking on; <sle/><qs/>'and so you will.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="4" id="ED.c6.p4" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="ED.c6.s7"><qs/>'Do what, Ma dear?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="ED.c6.p5" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="ED.c6.s8"><qs/>'Break the pier-glass, or burst a blood-vessel.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="ED.c6.p6" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="ED.c6.s9"><qs/>'Neither, please God, Ma dear.</s> <s sid="10" id="ED.c6.s10">Here's wind, Ma.</s> <s sid="11" id="ED.c6.s11">Look at this!'<qe/></s> <s sid="12" id="ED.c6.s12">In a concluding round of great severity, the Reverend Septimus administered and escaped all sorts of punishment, and wound up by getting the old lady's cap into Chancery--such is the technical term used in scientific circles by the learned in the Noble Art-- with a lightness of touch that hardly stirred the lightest lavender or cherry riband on it.</s> <s sid="13" id="ED.c6.s13">Magnanimously releasing the defeated, just in time to get his gloves into a drawer and feign to be looking out of window in a contemplative state of mind when a servant entered, the Reverend Septimus then gave place to the urn and other preparations for breakfast.</s> <s sid="14" id="ED.c6.s14">These completed, and the two alone again, it was pleasant to see (or would have been, if there had been any one to see it, which there never was), the old lady standing to say the Lord's Prayer aloud, and her son, Minor Canon nevertheless, standing with bent head to hear it, he being within five years of forty:  much as he had stood to hear the same words from the same lips when he was within five months of four.</s> </p><p pid="7" id="ED.c6.p7" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="ED.c6.s15">What is prettier than an old lady--except a young lady--when her eyes are bright, when her figure is trim and compact, when her face is cheerful and calm, when her dress is as the dress of a china shepherdess:  so dainty in its colours, so individually assorted to herself, so neatly moulded on her?</s> <s sid="16" id="ED.c6.s16">Nothing is prettier, thought the good Minor Canon frequently, when taking his seat at table opposite his long-widowed mother.</s> <s sid="17" id="ED.c6.s17">Her thought at such times may be condensed into the two words that oftenest did duty together in all her conversations:</s> <s sid="18" id="ED.c6.s18"><qs/>'My Sept!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="8" id="ED.c6.p8"><s sid="19" id="ED.c6.s19">They were a good pair to sit breakfasting together in Minor Canon Corner, Cloisterham.</s> <s sid="20" id="ED.c6.s20">For Minor Canon Corner was a quiet place in the shadow of the Cathedral, which the cawing of the rooks, the echoing footsteps of rare passers, the sound of the Cathedral bell, or the roll of the Cathedral organ, seemed to render more quiet than absolute silence.</s> <s sid="21" id="ED.c6.s21">Swaggering fighting men had had their centuries of ramping and raving about Minor Canon Corner, and beaten serfs had had their centuries of drudging and dying there, and powerful monks had had their centuries of being sometimes useful and sometimes harmful there, and behold they were all gone out of Minor Canon Corner, and so much the better.</s> <s sid="22" id="ED.c6.s22">Perhaps one of the highest uses of their ever having been there, was, that there might be left behind, that blessed air of tranquillity which pervaded Minor Canon Corner, and that serenely romantic state of the mind--productive for the most part of pity and forbearance-- which is engendered by a sorrowful story that is all told, or a pathetic play that is played out.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="ED.c6.p9"><s sid="23" id="ED.c6.s23">Red-brick walls harmoniously toned down in colour by time, strong- rooted ivy, latticed windows, panelled rooms, big oaken beams in little places, and stone-walled gardens where annual fruit yet ripened upon monkish trees, were the principal surroundings of pretty old Mrs. Crisparkle and the Reverend Septimus as they sat at breakfast.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="ED.c6.p10" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="ED.c6.s24"><qs/>'And what, Ma dear,'<qe/><sls/> inquired the Minor Canon, giving proof of a wholesome and vigorous appetite, <sle/><qs/>'does the letter say?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="ED.c6.p11"><s sid="25" id="ED.c6.s25">The pretty old lady, after reading it, had just laid it down upon the breakfast-cloth.</s> <s sid="26" id="ED.c6.s26">She handed it over to her son.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="ED.c6.p12"><s sid="27" id="ED.c6.s27">Now, the old lady was exceedingly proud of her bright eyes being so clear that she could read writing without spectacles.</s> <s sid="28" id="ED.c6.s28">Her son was also so proud of the circumstance, and so dutifully bent on her deriving the utmost possible gratification from it, that he had invented the pretence that he himself could NOT read writing without spectacles.</s> <s sid="29" id="ED.c6.s29">Therefore he now assumed a pair, of grave and prodigious proportions, which not only seriously inconvenienced his nose and his breakfast, but seriously impeded his perusal of the letter.</s> <s sid="30" id="ED.c6.s30">For, he had the eyes of a microscope and a telescope combined, when they were unassisted.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER IX--BIRDS IN THE BUSH</title>

<p pid="1" id="ED.c9.p1"><s sid="1" id="ED.c9.s1">Rosa, having no relation that she knew of in the world, had, from the seventh year of her age, known no home but the Nuns' House, and no mother but Miss Twinkleton.</s> <s sid="2" id="ED.c9.s2">Her remembrance of her own mother was of a pretty little creature like herself (not much older than herself it seemed to her), who had been brought home in her father's arms, drowned.</s> <s sid="3" id="ED.c9.s3">The fatal accident had happened at a party of pleasure.</s> <s sid="4" id="ED.c9.s4">Every fold and colour in the pretty summer dress, and even the long wet hair, with scattered petals of ruined flowers still clinging to it, as the dead young figure, in its sad, sad beauty lay upon the bed, were fixed indelibly in Rosa's recollection.</s> <s sid="5" id="ED.c9.s5">So were the wild despair and the subsequent bowed- down grief of her poor young father, who died broken-hearted on the first anniversary of that hard day.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ED.c9.p2"><s sid="6" id="ED.c9.s6">The betrothal of Rosa grew out of the soothing of his year of mental distress by his fast friend and old college companion, Drood:  who likewise had been left a widower in his youth.</s> <s sid="7" id="ED.c9.s7">But he, too, went the silent road into which all earthly pilgrimages merge, some sooner, and some later; and thus the young couple had come to be as they were.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="ED.c9.p3"><s sid="8" id="ED.c9.s8">The atmosphere of pity surrounding the little orphan girl when she first came to Cloisterham, had never cleared away.</s> <s sid="9" id="ED.c9.s9">It had taken brighter hues as she grew older, happier, prettier; now it had been golden, now roseate, and now azure; but it had always adorned her with some soft light of its own.</s> <s sid="10" id="ED.c9.s10">The general desire to console and caress her, had caused her to be treated in the beginning as a child much younger than her years; the same desire had caused her to be still petted when she was a child no longer.</s> <s sid="11" id="ED.c9.s11">Who should be her favourite, who should anticipate this or that small present, or do her this or that small service; who should take her home for the holidays; who should write to her the oftenest when they were separated, and whom she would most rejoice to see again when they were reunited; even these gentle rivalries were not without their slight dashes of bitterness in the Nuns' House.</s> <s sid="12" id="ED.c9.s12">Well for the poor Nuns in their day, if they hid no harder strife under their veils and rosaries!</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="ED.c9.p4"><s sid="13" id="ED.c9.s13">Thus Rosa had grown to be an amiable, giddy, wilful, winning little creature; spoilt, in the sense of counting upon kindness from all around her; but not in the sense of repaying it with indifference.</s> <s sid="14" id="ED.c9.s14">Possessing an exhaustless well of affection in her nature, its sparkling waters had freshened and brightened the Nuns' House for years, and yet its depths had never yet been moved:  what might betide when that came to pass; what developing changes might fall upon the heedless head, and light heart, then; remained to be seen.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="ED.c9.p5"><s sid="15" id="ED.c9.s15">By what means the news that there had been a quarrel between the two young men overnight, involving even some kind of onslaught by Mr. Neville upon Edwin Drood, got into Miss Twinkleton's establishment before breakfast, it is impossible to say.</s> <s sid="16" id="ED.c9.s16">Whether it was brought in by the birds of the air, or came blowing in with the very air itself, when the casement windows were set open; whether the baker brought it kneaded into the bread, or the milkman delivered it as part of the adulteration of his milk; or the housemaids, beating the dust out of their mats against the gateposts, received it in exchange deposited on the mats by the town atmosphere; certain it is that the news permeated every gable of the old building before Miss Twinkleton was down, and that Miss Twinkleton herself received it through Mrs. Tisher, while yet in the act of dressing; or (as she might have expressed the phrase to a parent or guardian of a mythological turn) of sacrificing to the Graces.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="ED.c9.p10"><s sid="21" id="ED.c9.s21">Well, then.</s> <s sid="22" id="ED.c9.s22">Miss Landless's brother had said he admired Miss Bud.</s> <s sid="23" id="ED.c9.s23">Mr. Edwin Drood had said to Miss Landless's brother that he had no business to admire Miss Bud.</s> <s sid="24" id="ED.c9.s24">Miss Landless's brother had then 'up'd' (this was the cook's exact information) with the bottle, knife, fork, and decanter (the decanter now coolly flying at everybody's head, without the least introduction), and thrown them all at Mr. Edwin Drood.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="ED.c9.p11"><s sid="25" id="ED.c9.s25">Poor little Rosa put a forefinger into each of her ears when these rumours began to circulate, and retired into a corner, beseeching not to be told any more; but Miss Landless, begging permission of Miss Twinkleton to go and speak with her brother, and pretty plainly showing that she would take it if it were not given, struck out the more definite course of going to Mr. Crisparkle's for accurate intelligence.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="ED.c9.p12" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="ED.c9.s26">When she came back (being first closeted with Miss Twinkleton, in order that anything objectionable in her tidings might be retained by that discreet filter), she imparted to Rosa only, what had taken place; dwelling with a flushed cheek on the provocation her brother had received, but almost limiting it to that last gross affront as crowning <qs/>'some other words between them,'<qe/> and, out of consideration for her new friend, passing lightly over the fact that the other words had originated in her lover's taking things in general so very easily.</s> <s sid="27" id="ED.c9.s27">To Rosa direct, she brought a petition from her brother that she would forgive him; and, having delivered it with sisterly earnestness, made an end of the subject.</s> </p><p pid="13" id="ED.c9.p13" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="ED.c9.s28">It was reserved for Miss Twinkleton to tone down the public mind of the Nuns' House.</s> <s sid="29" id="ED.c9.s29">That lady, therefore, entering in a stately manner what plebeians might have called the school-room, but what, in the patrician language of the head of the Nuns' House, was euphuistically, not to say round-aboutedly, denominated <qs/>'the apartment allotted to study,'<qe/><sls/> and saying with a forensic air, <sle/><qs/>'Ladies!'<qe/> all rose.</s> <s sid="30" id="ED.c9.s30">Mrs. Tisher at the same time grouped herself behind her chief, as representing Queen Elizabeth's first historical female friend at Tilbury fort.</s> <s sid="31" id="ED.c9.s31">Miss Twinkleton then proceeded to remark that Rumour, Ladies, had been represented by the bard of Avon--needless were it to mention the immortal SHAKESPEARE, also called the Swan of his native river, not improbably with some reference to the ancient superstition that that bird of graceful plumage (Miss Jennings will please stand upright) sang sweetly on the approach of death, for which we have no ornithological authority,--Rumour, Ladies, had been represented by that bard--hem!</s> <s sid="32" id="ED.c9.s32">-</s> </p><p pid="14" id="ED.c9.p14" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="ED.c9.s33"><qs/>'who drew The celebrated Jew,'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="ED.c9.p15"><s sid="34" id="ED.c9.s34">as painted full of tongues.</s> <s sid="35" id="ED.c9.s35">Rumour in Cloisterham (Miss Ferdinand will honour me with her attention) was no exception to the great limner's portrait of Rumour elsewhere.</s> <s sid="36" id="ED.c9.s36">A slight fracas between two young gentlemen occurring last night within a hundred miles of these peaceful walls (Miss Ferdinand, being apparently incorrigible, will have the kindness to write out this evening, in the original language, the first four fables of our vivacious neighbour, Monsieur La Fontaine) had been very grossly exaggerated by Rumour's voice.</s> <s sid="37" id="ED.c9.s37">In the first alarm and anxiety arising from our sympathy with a sweet young friend, not wholly to be dissociated from one of the gladiators in the bloodless arena in question (the impropriety of Miss Reynolds's appearing to stab herself in the hand with a pin, is far too obvious, and too glaringly unladylike, to be pointed out), we descended from our maiden elevation to discuss this uncongenial and this unfit theme.</s> <s sid="38" id="ED.c9.s38">Responsible inquiries having assured us that it was but one of those 'airy nothings' pointed at by the Poet (whose name and date of birth Miss Giggles will supply within half an hour), we would now discard the subject, and concentrate our minds upon the grateful labours of the day.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="ED.c9.p16"><s sid="39" id="ED.c9.s39">But the subject so survived all day, nevertheless, that Miss Ferdinand got into new trouble by surreptitiously clapping on a paper moustache at dinner-time, and going through the motions of aiming a water-bottle at Miss Giggles, who drew a table-spoon in defence.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="ED.c9.p17"><s sid="40" id="ED.c9.s40">Now, Rosa thought of this unlucky quarrel a great deal, and thought of it with an uncomfortable feeling that she was involved in it, as cause, or consequence, or what not, through being in a false position altogether as to her marriage engagement.</s> <s sid="41" id="ED.c9.s41">Never free from such uneasiness when she was with her affianced husband, it was not likely that she would be free from it when they were apart.</s> <s sid="42" id="ED.c9.s42">To- day, too, she was cast in upon herself, and deprived of the relief of talking freely with her new friend, because the quarrel had been with Helena's brother, and Helena undisguisedly avoided the subject as a delicate and difficult one to herself.</s> <s sid="43" id="ED.c9.s43">At this critical time, of all times, Rosa's guardian was announced as having come to see her.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="ED.c17.p1"><s sid="1" id="ED.c17.s1">Full half a year had come and gone, and Mr. Crisparkle sat in a waiting-room in the London chief offices of the Haven of Philanthropy, until he could have audience of Mr. Honeythunder.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="ED.c17.p2"><s sid="2" id="ED.c17.s2">In his college days of athletic exercises, Mr. Crisparkle had known professors of the Noble Art of fisticuffs, and had attended two or three of their gloved gatherings.</s> <s sid="3" id="ED.c17.s3">He had now an opportunity of observing that as to the phrenological formation of the backs of their heads, the Professing Philanthropists were uncommonly like the Pugilists.</s> <s sid="4" id="ED.c17.s4">In the development of all those organs which constitute, or attend, a propensity to 'pitch into' your fellow- creatures, the Philanthropists were remarkably favoured.</s> <s sid="5" id="ED.c17.s5">There were several Professors passing in and out, with exactly the aggressive air upon them of being ready for a turn-up with any Novice who might happen to be on hand, that Mr. Crisparkle well remembered in the circles of the Fancy.</s> <s sid="6" id="ED.c17.s6">Preparations were in progress for a moral little Mill somewhere on the rural circuit, and other Professors were backing this or that Heavy-Weight as good for such or such speech-making hits, so very much after the manner of the sporting publicans, that the intended Resolutions might have been Rounds.</s> <s sid="7" id="ED.c17.s7">In an official manager of these displays much celebrated for his platform tactics, Mr. Crisparkle recognised (in a suit of black) the counterpart of a deceased benefactor of his species, an eminent public character, once known to fame as Frosty- faced Fogo, who in days of yore superintended the formation of the magic circle with the ropes and stakes.</s> <s sid="8" id="ED.c17.s8">There were only three conditions of resemblance wanting between these Professors and those.</s> <s sid="9" id="ED.c17.s9">Firstly, the Philanthropists were in very bad training: much too fleshy, and presenting, both in face and figure, a superabundance of what is known to Pugilistic Experts as Suet Pudding.</s> <s sid="10" id="ED.c17.s10">Secondly, the Philanthropists had not the good temper of the Pugilists, and used worse language.</s> <s sid="11" id="ED.c17.s11">Thirdly, their fighting code stood in great need of revision, as empowering them not only to bore their man to the ropes, but to bore him to the confines of distraction; also to hit him when he was down, hit him anywhere and anyhow, kick him, stamp upon him, gouge him, and maul him behind his back without mercy.</s> <s sid="12" id="ED.c17.s12">In these last particulars the Professors of the Noble Art were much nobler than the Professors of Philanthropy.</s> </p>
