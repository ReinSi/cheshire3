<stru>BARNABY RUDGE - A TALE OF THE RIOTS OF 'EIGHTY



by



Charles Dickens</stru>







<stru>PREFACE





The late Mr Waterton having, some time ago, expressed his opinion 

that ravens are gradually becoming extinct in England, I offered 

the few following words about my experience of these birds.



The raven in this story is a compound of two great originals, of 

whom I was, at different times, the proud possessor.  The first was 

in the bloom of his youth, when he was discovered in a modest 

retirement in London, by a friend of mine, and given to me.  He had 

from the first, as Sir Hugh Evans says of Anne Page, 'good gifts', 

which he improved by study and attention in a most exemplary 

manner.  He slept in a stable--generally on horseback--and so 

terrified a Newfoundland dog by his preternatural sagacity, that he 

has been known, by the mere superiority of his genius, to walk off 

unmolested with the dog's dinner, from before his face.  He was 

rapidly rising in acquirements and virtues, when, in an evil hour, 

his stable was newly painted.  He observed the workmen closely, 

saw that they were careful of the paint, and immediately burned to 

possess it.  On their going to dinner, he ate up all they had left 

behind, consisting of a pound or two of white lead; and this 

youthful indiscretion terminated in death.



While I was yet inconsolable for his loss, another friend of mine 

in Yorkshire discovered an older and more gifted raven at a village 

public-house, which he prevailed upon the landlord to part with for 

a consideration, and sent up to me.  The first act of this Sage, 

was, to administer to the effects of his predecessor, by 

disinterring all the cheese and halfpence he had buried in the 

garden--a work of immense labour and research, to which he devoted 

all the energies of his mind.  When he had achieved this task, he 

applied himself to the acquisition of stable language, in which he 

soon became such an adept, that he would perch outside my window 

and drive imaginary horses with great skill, all day.  Perhaps 

even I never saw him at his best, for his former master sent his 

duty with him, 'and if I wished the bird to come out very strong, 

would I be so good as to show him a drunken man'--which I never 

did, having (unfortunately) none but sober people at hand.



But I could hardly have respected him more, whatever the 

stimulating influences of this sight might have been.  He had not 

the least respect, I am sorry to say, for me in return, or for 

anybody but the cook; to whom he was attached--but only, I fear, as 

a Policeman might have been.  Once, I met him unexpectedly, about 

half-a-mile from my house, walking down the middle of a public 

street, attended by a pretty large crowd, and spontaneously 

exhibiting the whole of his accomplishments.  His gravity under 

those trying circumstances, I can never forget, nor the 

extraordinary gallantry with which, refusing to be brought home, he 

defended himself behind a pump, until overpowered by numbers.  It 

may have been that he was too bright a genius to live long, or it 

may have been that he took some pernicious substance into his bill, 

and thence into his maw--which is not improbable, seeing that he 

new-pointed the greater part of the garden-wall by digging out the 

mortar, broke countless squares of glass by scraping away the putty 

all round the frames, and tore up and swallowed, in splinters, the 

greater part of a wooden staircase of six steps and a landing--but 

after some three years he too was taken ill, and died before the 

kitchen fire.  He kept his eye to the last upon the meat as it 

roasted, and suddenly.  turned over on his back with a sepulchral 

cry of 'Cuckoo!'  Since then I have been ravenless.



No account of the Gordon Riots having been to my knowledge 

introduced into any Work of Fiction, and the subject presenting 

very extraordinary and remarkable features, I was led to project 

this Tale.



It is unnecessary to say, that those shameful tumults, while they 

reflect indelible disgrace upon the time in which they occurred, 

and all who had act or part in them, teach a good lesson.  That 

what we falsely call a religious cry is easily raised by men who 

have no religion, and who in their daily practice set at nought the 

commonest principles of right and wrong; that it is begotten of 

intolerance and persecution; that it is senseless, besotted, 

inveterate and unmerciful; all History teaches us.  But perhaps we 

do not know it in our hearts too well, to profit by even so humble 

an example as the 'No Popery' riots of Seventeen Hundred and Eighty.



However imperfectly those disturbances are set forth in the 

following pages, they are impartially painted by one who has no 

sympathy with the Romish Church, though he acknowledges, as most 

men do, some esteemed friends among the followers of its creed.



In the description of the principal outrages, reference has been 

had to the best authorities of that time, such as they are; the 

account given in this Tale, of all the main features of the Riots, 

is substantially correct.



Mr Dennis's allusions to the flourishing condition of his trade in 

those days, have their foundation in Truth, and not in the 

Author's fancy.  Any file of old Newspapers, or odd volume of the 

Annual Register, will prove this with terrible ease.



Even the case of Mary Jones, dwelt upon with so much pleasure by 

the same character, is no effort of invention.  The facts were 

stated, exactly as they are stated here, in the House of Commons.  

Whether they afforded as much entertainment to the merry gentlemen 

assembled there, as some other most affecting circumstances of a 

similar nature mentioned by Sir Samuel Romilly, is not recorded.



That the case of Mary Jones may speak the more emphatically for 

itself, I subjoin it, as related by SIR WILLIAM MEREDITH in a 

speech in Parliament, 'on Frequent Executions', made in 1777.



'Under this act,' the Shop-lifting Act, 'one Mary Jones was 

executed, whose case I shall just mention; it was at the time when 

press warrants were issued, on the alarm about Falkland Islands.  

The woman's husband was pressed, their goods seized for some debts 

of his, and she, with two small children, turned into the streets 

a-begging.  It is a circumstance not to be forgotten, that she was 

very young (under nineteen), and most remarkably handsome.  She 

went to a linen-draper's shop, took some coarse linen off the 

counter, and slipped it under her cloak; the shopman saw her, and 

she laid it down: for this she was hanged.  Her defence was (I have 

the trial in my pocket), "that she had lived in credit, and wanted 

for nothing, till a press-gang came and stole her husband from her; 

but since then, she had no bed to lie on; nothing to give her 

children to eat; and they were almost naked; and perhaps she might 

have done something wrong, for she hardly knew what she did."  The 

parish officers testified the truth of this story; but it seems, 

there had been a good deal of shop-lifting about Ludgate; an 

example was thought necessary; and this woman was hanged for the 

comfort and satisfaction of shopkeepers in Ludgate Street.  When 

brought to receive sentence, she behaved in such a frantic manner, 

as proved her mind to he in a distracted and desponding state; and 

the child was sucking at her breast when she set out for Tyburn.'</stru>

<title>Chapter 1</title>

<p pid="1" id="BR.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="BR.c1.s1">In the year 1775, there stood upon the borders of Epping Forest, at a distance of about twelve miles from London--measuring from the Standard in Cornhill,' or rather from the spot on or near to which the Standard used to be in days of yore--a house of public entertainment called the Maypole; which fact was demonstrated to all such travellers as could neither read nor write (and at that time a vast number both of travellers and stay-at-homes were in this condition) by the emblem reared on the roadside over against the house, which, if not of those goodly proportions that Maypoles were wont to present in olden times, was a fair young ash, thirty feet in height, and straight as any arrow that ever English yeoman drew.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="BR.c1.s2">The Maypole--by which term from henceforth is meant the house, and not its sign--the Maypole was an old building, with more gable ends than a lazy man would care to count on a sunny day; huge zig-zag chimneys, out of which it seemed as though even smoke could not choose but come in more than naturally fantastic shapes, imparted to it in its tortuous progress; and vast stables, gloomy, ruinous, and empty.</s> <s sid="3" id="BR.c1.s3">The place was said to have been built in the days of King Henry the Eighth; and there was a legend, not only that Queen Elizabeth had slept there one night while upon a hunting excursion, to wit, in a certain oak-panelled room with a deep bay window, but that next morning, while standing on a mounting block before the door with one foot in the stirrup, the virgin monarch had then and there boxed and cuffed an unlucky page for some neglect of duty.</s> <s sid="4" id="BR.c1.s4">The matter-of-fact and doubtful folks, of whom there were a few among the Maypole customers, as unluckily there always are in every little community, were inclined to look upon this tradition as rather apocryphal; but, whenever the landlord of that ancient hostelry appealed to the mounting block itself as evidence, and triumphantly pointed out that there it stood in the same place to that very day, the doubters never failed to be put down by a large majority, and all true believers exulted as in a victory.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BR.c1.p3"><s sid="5" id="BR.c1.s5">Whether these, and many other stories of the like nature, were true or untrue, the Maypole was really an old house, a very old house, perhaps as old as it claimed to be, and perhaps older, which will sometimes happen with houses of an uncertain, as with ladies of a certain, age.</s> <s sid="6" id="BR.c1.s6">Its windows were old diamond-pane lattices, its floors were sunken and uneven, its ceilings blackened by the hand of time, and heavy with massive beams.</s> <s sid="7" id="BR.c1.s7">Over the doorway was an ancient porch, quaintly and grotesquely carved; and here on summer evenings the more favoured customers smoked and drank--ay, and sang many a good song too, sometimes--reposing on two grim-looking high-backed settles, which, like the twin dragons of some fairy tale, guarded the entrance to the mansion.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BR.c1.p4"><s sid="8" id="BR.c1.s8">In the chimneys of the disused rooms, swallows had built their nests for many a long year, and from earliest spring to latest autumn whole colonies of sparrows chirped and twittered in the eaves.</s> <s sid="9" id="BR.c1.s9">There were more pigeons about the dreary stable-yard and out-buildings than anybody but the landlord could reckon up.</s> <s sid="10" id="BR.c1.s10">The wheeling and circling flights of runts, fantails, tumblers, and pouters, were perhaps not quite consistent with the grave and sober character of the building, but the monotonous cooing, which never ceased to be raised by some among them all day long, suited it exactly, and seemed to lull it to rest.</s> <s sid="11" id="BR.c1.s11">With its overhanging stories, drowsy little panes of glass, and front bulging out and projecting over the pathway, the old house looked as if it were nodding in its sleep.</s> <s sid="12" id="BR.c1.s12">Indeed, it needed no very great stretch of fancy to detect in it other resemblances to humanity.</s> <s sid="13" id="BR.c1.s13">The bricks of which it was built had originally been a deep dark red, but had grown yellow and discoloured like an old man's skin; the sturdy timbers had decayed like teeth; and here and there the ivy, like a warm garment to comfort it in its age, wrapt its green leaves closely round the time-worn walls.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BR.c1.p5"><s sid="14" id="BR.c1.s14">It was a hale and hearty age though, still: and in the summer or autumn evenings, when the glow of the setting sun fell upon the oak and chestnut trees of the adjacent forest, the old house, partaking of its lustre, seemed their fit companion, and to have many good years of life in him yet.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="BR.c1.p6"><s sid="15" id="BR.c1.s15">The evening with which we have to do, was neither a summer nor an autumn one, but the twilight of a day in March, when the wind howled dismally among the bare branches of the trees, and rumbling in the wide chimneys and driving the rain against the windows of the Maypole Inn, gave such of its frequenters as chanced to be there at the moment an undeniable reason for prolonging their stay, and caused the landlord to prophesy that the night would certainly clear at eleven o'clock precisely,--which by a remarkable coincidence was the hour at which he always closed his house.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="BR.c1.p7"><s sid="16" id="BR.c1.s16">The name of him upon whom the spirit of prophecy thus descended was John Willet, a burly, large-headed man with a fat face, which betokened profound obstinacy and slowness of apprehension, combined with a very strong reliance upon his own merits.</s> <s sid="17" id="BR.c1.s17">It was John Willet's ordinary boast in his more placid moods that if he were slow he was sure; which assertion could, in one sense at least, be by no means gainsaid, seeing that he was in everything unquestionably the reverse of fast, and withal one of the most dogged and positive fellows in existence--always sure that what he thought or said or did was right, and holding it as a thing quite settled and ordained by the laws of nature and Providence, that anybody who said or did or thought otherwise must be inevitably and of necessity wrong.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="BR.c1.p8"><s sid="18" id="BR.c1.s18">Mr Willet walked slowly up to the window, flattened his fat nose against the cold glass, and shading his eyes that his sight might not be affected by the ruddy glow of the fire, looked abroad.</s> <s sid="19" id="BR.c1.s19">Then he walked slowly back to his old seat in the chimney-corner, and, composing himself in it with a slight shiver, such as a man might give way to and so acquire an additional relish for the warm blaze, said, looking round upon his guests:</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="BR.c1.p9"><s sid="20" id="BR.c1.s20">'It'll clear at eleven o'clock.</s> <s sid="21" id="BR.c1.s21">No sooner and no later.</s> <s sid="22" id="BR.c1.s22">Not before and not arterwards.'</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="BR.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="BR.c1.s23"><qs/>'How do you make out that?'<qe/> said a little man in the opposite corner.</s> <s sid="24" id="BR.c1.s24"><qs/>'The moon is past the full, and she rises at nine.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="BR.c1.p11"><s sid="25" id="BR.c1.s25">John looked sedately and solemnly at his questioner until he had brought his mind to bear upon the whole of his observation, and then made answer, in a tone which seemed to imply that the moon was peculiarly his business and nobody else's:</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="BR.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="BR.c1.s26"><qs/>'Never you mind about the moon.</s> <s sid="27" id="BR.c1.s27">Don't you trouble yourself about her.</s> <s sid="28" id="BR.c1.s28">You let the moon alone, and I'll let you alone.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="BR.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="BR.c1.s29"><qs/>'No offence I hope?'<qe/> said the little man.</s> </p><p pid="14" id="BR.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="BR.c1.s30">Again John waited leisurely until the observation had thoroughly penetrated to his brain, and then replying, <qs/>'No offence as YET,'<qe/> applied a light to his pipe and smoked in placid silence; now and then casting a sidelong look at a man wrapped in a loose riding- coat with huge cuffs ornamented with tarnished silver lace and large metal buttons, who sat apart from the regular frequenters of the house, and wearing a hat flapped over his face, which was still further shaded by the hand on which his forehead rested, looked unsociable enough.</s> </p><p pid="15" id="BR.c1.p15"><s sid="31" id="BR.c1.s31">There was another guest, who sat, booted and spurred, at some distance from the fire also, and whose thoughts--to judge from his folded arms and knitted brows, and from the untasted liquor before him--were occupied with other matters than the topics under discussion or the persons who discussed them.</s> <s sid="32" id="BR.c1.s32">This was a young man of about eight-and-twenty, rather above the middle height, and though of somewhat slight figure, gracefully and strongly made.</s> <s sid="33" id="BR.c1.s33">He wore his own dark hair, and was accoutred in a riding dress, which together with his large boots (resembling in shape and fashion those worn by our Life Guardsmen at the present day), showed indisputable traces of the bad condition of the roads.</s> <s sid="34" id="BR.c1.s34">But travel- stained though he was, he was well and even richly attired, and without being overdressed looked a gallant gentleman.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="BR.c1.p16"><s sid="35" id="BR.c1.s35">Lying upon the table beside him, as he had carelessly thrown them down, were a heavy riding-whip and a slouched hat, the latter worn no doubt as being best suited to the inclemency of the weather.</s> <s sid="36" id="BR.c1.s36">There, too, were a pair of pistols in a holster-case, and a short riding-cloak.</s> <s sid="37" id="BR.c1.s37">Little of his face was visible, except the long dark lashes which concealed his downcast eyes, but an air of careless ease and natural gracefulness of demeanour pervaded the figure, and seemed to comprehend even those slight accessories, which were all handsome, and in good keeping.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="BR.c1.p17"><s sid="38" id="BR.c1.s38">Towards this young gentleman the eyes of Mr Willet wandered but once, and then as if in mute inquiry whether he had observed his silent neighbour.</s> <s sid="39" id="BR.c1.s39">It was plain that John and the young gentleman had often met before.</s> <s sid="40" id="BR.c1.s40">Finding that his look was not returned, or indeed observed by the person to whom it was addressed, John gradually concentrated the whole power of his eyes into one focus, and brought it to bear upon the man in the flapped hat, at whom he came to stare in course of time with an intensity so remarkable, that it affected his fireside cronies, who all, as with one accord, took their pipes from their lips, and stared with open mouths at the stranger likewise.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="BR.c1.p18"><s sid="41" id="BR.c1.s41">The sturdy landlord had a large pair of dull fish-like eyes, and the little man who had hazarded the remark about the moon (and who was the parish-clerk and bell-ringer of Chigwell, a village hard by) had little round black shiny eyes like beads; moreover this little man wore at the knees of his rusty black breeches, and on his rusty black coat, and all down his long flapped waistcoat, little queer buttons like nothing except his eyes; but so like them, that as they twinkled and glistened in the light of the fire, which shone too in his bright shoe-buckles, he seemed all eyes from head to foot, and to be gazing with every one of them at the unknown customer.</s> <s sid="42" id="BR.c1.s42">No wonder that a man should grow restless under such an inspection as this, to say nothing of the eyes belonging to short Tom Cobb the general chandler and post-office keeper, and long Phil Parkes the ranger, both of whom, infected by the example of their companions, regarded him of the flapped hat no less attentively.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="BR.c1.p19"><s sid="43" id="BR.c1.s43">The stranger became restless; perhaps from being exposed to this raking fire of eyes, perhaps from the nature of his previous meditations--most probably from the latter cause, for as he changed his position and looked hastily round, he started to find himself the object of such keen regard, and darted an angry and suspicious glance at the fireside group.</s> <s sid="44" id="BR.c1.s44">It had the effect of immediately diverting all eyes to the chimney, except those of John Willet, who finding himself as it were, caught in the fact, and not being (as has been already observed) of a very ready nature, remained staring at his guest in a particularly awkward and disconcerted manner.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="BR.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="BR.c1.s45"><qs/>'Well?'<qe/> said the stranger.</s> </p><p pid="21" id="BR.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="BR.c1.s46">Well.</s> <s sid="47" id="BR.c1.s47">There was not much in well.</s> <s sid="48" id="BR.c1.s48">It was not a long speech.</s> <s sid="49" id="BR.c1.s49"><qs/>'I thought you gave an order,'<qe/> said the landlord, after a pause of two or three minutes for consideration.</s> </p><p pid="22" id="BR.c1.p22"><s sid="50" id="BR.c1.s50">The stranger took off his hat, and disclosed the hard features of a man of sixty or thereabouts, much weatherbeaten and worn by time, and the naturally harsh expression of which was not improved by a dark handkerchief which was bound tightly round his head, and, while it served the purpose of a wig, shaded his forehead, and almost hid his eyebrows.</s> <s sid="51" id="BR.c1.s51">If it were intended to conceal or divert attention from a deep gash, now healed into an ugly seam, which when it was first inflicted must have laid bare his cheekbone, the object was but indifferently attained, for it could scarcely fail to be noted at a glance.</s> <s sid="52" id="BR.c1.s52">His complexion was of a cadaverous hue, and he had a grizzly jagged beard of some three weeks' date.</s> <s sid="53" id="BR.c1.s53">Such was the figure (very meanly and poorly clad) that now rose from the seat, and stalking across the room sat down in a corner of the chimney, which the politeness or fears of the little clerk very readily assigned to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="BR.c1.p23" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="BR.c1.s54"><qs/>'A highwayman!'<qe/> whispered Tom Cobb to Parkes the ranger.</s> </p><p pid="24" id="BR.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="BR.c1.s55"><qs/>'Do you suppose highwaymen don't dress handsomer than that?'<qe/> replied Parkes.</s> <s sid="56" id="BR.c1.s56"><qs/>'It's a better business than you think for, Tom, and highwaymen don't need or use to be shabby, take my word for it.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="BR.c1.p25"><s sid="57" id="BR.c1.s57">Meanwhile the subject of their speculations had done due honour to the house by calling for some drink, which was promptly supplied by the landlord's son Joe, a broad-shouldered strapping young fellow of twenty, whom it pleased his father still to consider a little boy, and to treat accordingly.</s> <s sid="58" id="BR.c1.s58">Stretching out his hands to warm them by the blazing fire, the man turned his head towards the company, and after running his eye sharply over them, said in a voice well suited to his appearance:</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="BR.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="BR.c1.s59"><qs/>'What house is that which stands a mile or so from here?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="27" id="BR.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="BR.c1.s60"><qs/>'Public-house?'<qe/> said the landlord, with his usual deliberation.</s> </p><p pid="28" id="BR.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="BR.c1.s61"><qs/>'Public-house, father!'<qe/><sss/> exclaimed Joe, <sse/><qs/>'where's the public-house within a mile or so of the Maypole?</s> <s sid="62" id="BR.c1.s62">He means the great house--the Warren--naturally and of course.</s> <s sid="63" id="BR.c1.s63">The old red brick house, sir, that stands in its own grounds--?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="29" id="BR.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="BR.c1.s64"><qs/>'Aye,'<qe/> said the stranger.</s> </p><p pid="30" id="BR.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="BR.c1.s65"><qs/>'And that fifteen or twenty years ago stood in a park five times as broad, which with other and richer property has bit by bit changed hands and dwindled away--more's the pity!'<qe/> pursued the young man.</s> </p><p pid="31" id="BR.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="BR.c1.s66"><qs/>'Maybe,'<qe/> was the reply.</s> <s sid="67" id="BR.c1.s67"><qs/>'But my question related to the owner.</s> <s sid="68" id="BR.c1.s68">What it has been I don't care to know, and what it is I can see for myself.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="32" id="BR.c1.p32"><s sid="69" id="BR.c1.s69">The heir-apparent to the Maypole pressed his finger on his lips, and glancing at the young gentleman already noticed, who had changed his attitude when the house was first mentioned, replied in a lower tone:</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="BR.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="BR.c1.s70"><qs/>'The owner's name is Haredale, Mr Geoffrey Haredale, and'<qe/><sls/>--again he glanced in the same direction as before--<sle/><qs/>'and a worthy gentleman too--hem!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="34" id="BR.c1.p34"><s sid="71" id="BR.c1.s71">Paying as little regard to this admonitory cough, as to the significant gesture that had preceded it, the stranger pursued his questioning.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BR.c4.p1"><s sid="1" id="BR.c4.s1">In the venerable suburb--it was a suburb once--of Clerkenwell, towards that part of its confines which is nearest to the Charter House, and in one of those cool, shady Streets, of which a few, widely scattered and dispersed, yet remain in such old parts of the metropolis,--each tenement quietly vegetating like an ancient citizen who long ago retired from business, and dozing on in its infirmity until in course of time it tumbles down, and is replaced by some extravagant young heir, flaunting in stucco and ornamental work, and all the vanities of modern days,--in this quarter, and in a street of this description, the business of the present chapter lies.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c4.p2"><s sid="2" id="BR.c4.s2">At the time of which it treats, though only six-and-sixty years ago, a very large part of what is London now had no existence.</s> <s sid="3" id="BR.c4.s3">Even in the brains of the wildest speculators, there had sprung up no long rows of streets connecting Highgate with Whitechapel, no assemblages of palaces in the swampy levels, nor little cities in the open fields.</s> <s sid="4" id="BR.c4.s4">Although this part of town was then, as now, parcelled out in streets, and plentifully peopled, it wore a different aspect.</s> <s sid="5" id="BR.c4.s5">There were gardens to many of the houses, and trees by the pavement side; with an air of freshness breathing up and down, which in these days would be sought in vain.</s> <s sid="6" id="BR.c4.s6">Fields were nigh at hand, through which the New River took its winding course, and where there was merry haymaking in the summer time.</s> <s sid="7" id="BR.c4.s7">Nature was not so far removed, or hard to get at, as in these days; and although there were busy trades in Clerkenwell, and working jewellers by scores, it was a purer place, with farm-houses nearer to it than many modern Londoners would readily believe, and lovers' walks at no great distance, which turned into squalid courts, long before the lovers of this age were born, or, as the phrase goes, thought of.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BR.c4.p3"><s sid="8" id="BR.c4.s8">In one of these streets, the cleanest of them all, and on the shady side of the way--for good housewives know that sunlight damages their cherished furniture, and so choose the shade rather than its intrusive glare--there stood the house with which we have to deal.</s> <s sid="9" id="BR.c4.s9">It was a modest building, not very straight, not large, not tall; not bold-faced, with great staring windows, but a shy, blinking house, with a conical roof going up into a peak over its garret window of four small panes of glass, like a cocked hat on the head of an elderly gentleman with one eye.</s> <s sid="10" id="BR.c4.s10">It was not built of brick or lofty stone, but of wood and plaster; it was not planned with a dull and wearisome regard to regularity, for no one window matched the other, or seemed to have the slightest reference to anything besides itself.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BR.c4.p4"><s sid="11" id="BR.c4.s11">The shop--for it had a shop--was, with reference to the first floor, where shops usually are; and there all resemblance between it and any other shop stopped short and ceased.</s> <s sid="12" id="BR.c4.s12">People who went in and out didn't go up a flight of steps to it, or walk easily in upon a level with the street, but dived down three steep stairs, as into a cellar.</s> <s sid="13" id="BR.c4.s13">Its floor was paved with stone and brick, as that of any other cellar might be; and in lieu of window framed and glazed it had a great black wooden flap or shutter, nearly breast high from the ground, which turned back in the day-time, admitting as much cold air as light, and very often more.</s> <s sid="14" id="BR.c4.s14">Behind this shop was a wainscoted parlour, looking first into a paved yard, and beyond that again into a little terrace garden, raised some feet above it.</s> <s sid="15" id="BR.c4.s15">Any stranger would have supposed that this wainscoted parlour, saving for the door of communication by which he had entered, was cut off and detached from all the world; and indeed most strangers on their first entrance were observed to grow extremely thoughtful, as weighing and pondering in their minds whether the upper rooms were only approachable by ladders from without; never suspecting that two of the most unassuming and unlikely doors in existence, which the most ingenious mechanician on earth must of necessity have supposed to be the doors of closets, opened out of this room--each without the smallest preparation, or so much as a quarter of an inch of passage--upon two dark winding flights of stairs, the one upward, the other downward, which were the sole means of communication between that chamber and the other portions of the house.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BR.c4.p5"><s sid="16" id="BR.c4.s16">With all these oddities, there was not a neater, more scrupulously tidy, or more punctiliously ordered house, in Clerkenwell, in London, in all England.</s> <s sid="17" id="BR.c4.s17">There were not cleaner windows, or whiter floors, or brighter Stoves, or more highly shining articles of furniture in old mahogany; there was not more rubbing, scrubbing, burnishing and polishing, in the whole street put together.</s> <s sid="18" id="BR.c4.s18">Nor was this excellence attained without some cost and trouble and great expenditure of voice, as the neighbours were frequently reminded when the good lady of the house overlooked and assisted in its being put to rights on cleaning days--which were usually from Monday morning till Saturday night, both days inclusive.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="BR.c4.p7"><s sid="21" id="BR.c4.s21">After a long and patient contemplation of the golden key, and many such backward glances, Gabriel stepped into the road, and stole a look at the upper windows.</s> <s sid="22" id="BR.c4.s22">One of them chanced to be thrown open at the moment, and a roguish face met his; a face lighted up by the loveliest pair of sparkling eyes that ever locksmith looked upon; the face of a pretty, laughing, girl; dimpled and fresh, and healthful--the very impersonation of good-humour and blooming beauty.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c7.p2"><s sid="4" id="BR.c7.s4">It had been observed in this good lady (who did not want for personal attractions, being plump and buxom to look at, though like her fair daughter, somewhat short in stature) that this uncertainty of disposition strengthened and increased with her temporal prosperity; and divers wise men and matrons, on friendly terms with the locksmith and his family, even went so far as to assert, that a tumble down some half-dozen rounds in the world's ladder--such as the breaking of the bank in which her husband kept his money, or some little fall of that kind--would be the making of her, and could hardly fail to render her one of the most agreeable companions in existence.</s> <s sid="5" id="BR.c7.s5">Whether they were right or wrong in this conjecture, certain it is that minds, like bodies, will often fall into a pimpled ill-conditioned state from mere excess of comfort, and like them, are often successfully cured by remedies in themselves very nauseous and unpalatable.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BR.c10.p1"><s sid="1" id="BR.c10.s1">It was on one of those mornings, common in early spring, when the year, fickle and changeable in its youth like all other created things, is undecided whether to step backward into winter or forward into summer, and in its uncertainty inclines now to the one and now to the other, and now to both at once--wooing summer in the sunshine, and lingering still with winter in the shade--it was, in short, on one of those mornings, when it is hot and cold, wet and dry, bright and lowering, sad and cheerful, withering and genial, in the compass of one short hour, that old John Willet, who was dropping asleep over the copper boiler, was roused by the sound of a horse's feet, and glancing out at window, beheld a traveller of goodly promise, checking his bridle at the Maypole door.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c10.p2"><s sid="2" id="BR.c10.s2">He was none of your flippant young fellows, who would call for a tankard of mulled ale, and make themselves as much at home as if they had ordered a hogshead of wine; none of your audacious young swaggerers, who would even penetrate into the bar--that solemn sanctuary--and, smiting old John upon the back, inquire if there was never a pretty girl in the house, and where he hid his little chambermaids, with a hundred other impertinences of that nature; none of your free-and-easy companions, who would scrape their boots upon the firedogs in the common room, and be not at all particular on the subject of spittoons; none of your unconscionable blades, requiring impossible chops, and taking unheard-of pickles for granted.</s> <s sid="3" id="BR.c10.s3">He was a staid, grave, placid gentleman, something past the prime of life, yet upright in his carriage, for all that, and slim as a greyhound.</s> <s sid="4" id="BR.c10.s4">He was well-mounted upon a sturdy chestnut cob, and had the graceful seat of an experienced horseman; while his riding gear, though free from such fopperies as were then in vogue, was handsome and well chosen.</s> <s sid="5" id="BR.c10.s5">He wore a riding-coat of a somewhat brighter green than might have been expected to suit the taste of a gentleman of his years, with a short, black velvet cape, and laced pocket-holes and cuffs, all of a jaunty fashion; his linen, too, was of the finest kind, worked in a rich pattern at the wrists and throat, and scrupulously white.</s> <s sid="6" id="BR.c10.s6">Although he seemed, judging from the mud he had picked up on the way, to have come from London, his horse was as smooth and cool as his own iron-grey periwig and pigtail.</s> <s sid="7" id="BR.c10.s7">Neither man nor beast had turned a single hair; and saving for his soiled skirts and spatter-dashes, this gentleman, with his blooming face, white teeth, exactly-ordered dress, and perfect calmness, might have come from making an elaborate and leisurely toilet, to sit for an equestrian portrait at old John Willet's gate.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BR.c10.p3"><s sid="8" id="BR.c10.s8">It must not be supposed that John observed these several characteristics by other than very slow degrees, or that he took in more than half a one at a time, or that he even made up his mind upon that, without a great deal of very serious consideration.</s> <s sid="9" id="BR.c10.s9">Indeed, if he had been distracted in the first instance by questionings and orders, it would have taken him at the least a fortnight to have noted what is here set down; but it happened that the gentleman, being struck with the old house, or with the plump pigeons which were skimming and curtseying about it, or with the tall maypole, on the top of which a weathercock, which had been out of order for fifteen years, performed a perpetual walk to the music of its own creaking, sat for some little time looking round in silence.</s> <s sid="10" id="BR.c10.s10">Hence John, standing with his hand upon the horse's bridle, and his great eyes on the rider, and with nothing passing to divert his thoughts, had really got some of these little circumstances into his brain by the time he was called upon to speak.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="BR.c10.p13" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="BR.c10.s28"><qs/>'Pillory the fellow, here he is at last!'<qe/> cried John, in the very height and zenith of his distress.</s> <s sid="29" id="BR.c10.s29"><qs/>'Did you hear me a calling, villain?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="BR.c10.p14"><s sid="30" id="BR.c10.s30">The figure he addressed made no answer, but putting his hand upon the saddle, sprung into it at a bound, turned the horse's head towards the stable, and was gone in an instant.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="BR.c10.p18"><s sid="38" id="BR.c10.s38">It was spacious enough in all conscience, occupying the whole depth of the house, and having at either end a great bay window, as large as many modern rooms; in which some few panes of stained glass, emblazoned with fragments of armorial bearings, though cracked, and patched, and shattered, yet remained; attesting, by their presence, that the former owner had made the very light subservient to his state, and pressed the sun itself into his list of flatterers; bidding it, when it shone into his chamber, reflect the badges of his ancient family, and take new hues and colours from their pride.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="BR.c10.p19"><s sid="39" id="BR.c10.s39">But those were old days, and now every little ray came and went as it would; telling the plain, bare, searching truth.</s> <s sid="40" id="BR.c10.s40">Although the best room of the inn, it had the melancholy aspect of grandeur in decay, and was much too vast for comfort.</s> <s sid="41" id="BR.c10.s41">Rich rustling hangings, waving on the walls; and, better far, the rustling of youth and beauty's dress; the light of women's eyes, outshining the tapers and their own rich jewels; the sound of gentle tongues, and music, and the tread of maiden feet, had once been there, and filled it with delight.</s> <s sid="42" id="BR.c10.s42">But they were gone, and with them all its gladness.</s> <s sid="43" id="BR.c10.s43">It was no longer a home; children were never born and bred there; the fireside had become mercenary--a something to be bought and sold--a very courtezan: let who would die, or sit beside, or leave it, it was still the same--it missed nobody, cared for nobody, had equal warmth and smiles for all.</s> <s sid="44" id="BR.c10.s44">God help the man whose heart ever changes with the world, as an old mansion when it becomes an inn!</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BR.c13.p1"><s sid="1" id="BR.c13.s1">If Joseph Willet, the denounced and proscribed of 'prentices, had happened to be at home when his father's courtly guest presented himself before the Maypole door--that is, if it had not perversely chanced to be one of the half-dozen days in the whole year on which he was at liberty to absent himself for as many hours without question or reproach--he would have contrived, by hook or crook, to dive to the very bottom of Mr Chester's mystery, and to come at his purpose with as much certainty as though he had been his confidential adviser.</s> <s sid="2" id="BR.c13.s2">In that fortunate case, the lovers would have had quick warning of the ills that threatened them, and the aid of various timely and wise suggestions to boot; for all Joe's readiness of thought and action, and all his sympathies and good wishes, were enlisted in favour of the young people, and were staunch in devotion to their cause.</s> <s sid="3" id="BR.c13.s3">Whether this disposition arose out of his old prepossessions in favour of the young lady, whose history had surrounded her in his mind, almost from his cradle, with circumstances of unusual interest; or from his attachment towards the young gentleman, into whose confidence he had, through his shrewdness and alacrity, and the rendering of sundry important services as a spy and messenger, almost imperceptibly glided; whether they had their origin in either of these sources, or in the habit natural to youth, or in the constant badgering and worrying of his venerable parent, or in any hidden little love affair of his own which gave him something of a fellow-feeling in the matter, it is needless to inquire--especially as Joe was out of the way, and had no opportunity on that particular occasion of testifying to his sentiments either on one side or the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="BR.c13.p25"><s sid="61" id="BR.c13.s61">The unfortunate grey mare, who was the agony of Joe's life, floundered along at her own will and pleasure until the Maypole was no longer visible, and then, contracting her legs into what in a puppet would have been looked upon as a clumsy and awkward imitation of a canter, mended her pace all at once, and did it of her own accord.</s> <s sid="62" id="BR.c13.s62">The acquaintance with her rider's usual mode of proceeding, which suggested this improvement in hers, impelled her likewise to turn up a bye-way, leading--not to London, but through lanes running parallel with the road they had come, and passing within a few hundred yards of the Maypole, which led finally to an inclosure surrounding a large, old, red-brick mansion--the same of which mention was made as the Warren in the first chapter of this history.</s> <s sid="63" id="BR.c13.s63">Coming to a dead stop in a little copse thereabout, she suffered her rider to dismount with right goodwill, and to tie her to the trunk of a tree.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="BR.c13.p28"><s sid="68" id="BR.c13.s68">The terrace-garden, dark with the shade of overhanging trees, had an air of melancholy that was quite oppressive.</s> <s sid="69" id="BR.c13.s69">Great iron gates, disused for many years, and red with rust, drooping on their hinges and overgrown with long rank grass, seemed as though they tried to sink into the ground, and hide their fallen state among the friendly weeds.</s> <s sid="70" id="BR.c13.s70">The fantastic monsters on the walls, green with age and damp, and covered here and there with moss, looked grim and desolate.</s> <s sid="71" id="BR.c13.s71">There was a sombre aspect even on that part of the mansion which was inhabited and kept in good repair, that struck the beholder with a sense of sadness; of something forlorn and failing, whence cheerfulness was banished.</s> <s sid="72" id="BR.c13.s72">It would have been difficult to imagine a bright fire blazing in the dull and darkened rooms, or to picture any gaiety of heart or revelry that the frowning walls shut in.</s> <s sid="73" id="BR.c13.s73">It seemed a place where such things had been, but could be no more--the very ghost of a house, haunting the old spot in its old outward form, and that was all.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="BR.c13.p29"><s sid="74" id="BR.c13.s74">Much of this decayed and sombre look was attributable, no doubt, to the death of its former master, and the temper of its present occupant; but remembering the tale connected with the mansion, it seemed the very place for such a deed, and one that might have been its predestined theatre years upon years ago.</s> <s sid="75" id="BR.c13.s75">Viewed with reference to this legend, the sheet of water where the steward's body had been found appeared to wear a black and sullen character, such as no other pool might own; the bell upon the roof that had told the tale of murder to the midnight wind, became a very phantom whose voice would raise the listener's hair on end; and every leafless bough that nodded to another, had its stealthy whispering of the crime.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="BR.c20.p9"><s sid="17" id="BR.c20.s17">It was a long letter--a very long letter, written close on all four sides of the sheet of paper, and crossed afterwards; but it was not a consolatory letter, for as Emma read it she stopped from time to time to put her handkerchief to her eyes.</s> <s sid="18" id="BR.c20.s18">To be sure Dolly marvelled greatly to see her in so much distress, for to her thinking a love affair ought to be one of the best jokes, and the slyest, merriest kind of thing in life.</s> <s sid="19" id="BR.c20.s19">But she set it down in her own mind that all this came from Miss Haredale's being so constant, and that if she would only take on with some other young gentleman-- just in the most innocent way possible, to keep her first lover up to the mark--she would find herself inexpressibly comforted.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="BR.c20.p14"><s sid="30" id="BR.c20.s30">They strolled up and down the terrace walks, talking incessantly-- at least, Dolly never left off once--and making that quarter of the sad and mournful house quite gay.</s> <s sid="31" id="BR.c20.s31">Not that they talked loudly or laughed much, but they were both so very handsome, and it was such a breezy day, and their light dresses and dark curls appeared so free and joyous in their abandonment, and Emma was so fair, and Dolly so rosy, and Emma so delicately shaped, and Dolly so plump, and--in short, there are no flowers for any garden like such flowers, let horticulturists say what they may, and both house and garden seemed to know it, and to brighten up sensibly.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="BR.c20.p15"><s sid="32" id="BR.c20.s32">After this, came the dinner and the letter writing, and some more talking, in the course of which Miss Haredale took occasion to charge upon Dolly certain flirtish and inconstant propensities, which accusations Dolly seemed to think very complimentary indeed, and to be mightily amused with.</s> <s sid="33" id="BR.c20.s33">Finding her quite incorrigible in this respect, Emma suffered her to depart; but not before she had confided to her that important and never-sufficiently-to-be-taken- care-of answer, and endowed her moreover with a pretty little bracelet as a keepsake.</s> <s sid="34" id="BR.c20.s34">Having clasped it on her arm, and again advised her half in jest and half in earnest to amend her roguish ways, for she knew she was fond of Joe at heart (which Dolly stoutly denied, with a great many haughty protestations that she hoped she could do better than that indeed! and so forth), she bade her farewell; and after calling her back to give her more supplementary messages for Edward, than anybody with tenfold the gravity of Dolly Varden could be reasonably expected to remember, at length dismissed her.</s> </p>

<p pid="61" id="BR.c21.p61"><s sid="151" id="BR.c21.s151">Mrs Varden was seldom very Protestant at meals, unless it happened that they were underdone, or overdone, or indeed that anything occurred to put her out of humour.</s> <s sid="152" id="BR.c21.s152">Her spirits rose considerably on beholding these goodly preparations, and from the nothingness of good works, she passed to the somethingness of ham and toast with great cheerfulness.</s> <s sid="153" id="BR.c21.s153">Nay, under the influence of these wholesome stimulants, she sharply reproved her daughter for being low and despondent (which she considered an unacceptable frame of mind), and remarked, as she held her own plate for a fresh supply, that it would be well for Dolly, who pined over the loss of a toy and a sheet of paper, if she would reflect upon the voluntary sacrifices of the missionaries in foreign parts who lived chiefly on salads.</s> </p>

<p pid="62" id="BR.c21.p62"><s sid="154" id="BR.c21.s154">The proceedings of such a day occasion various fluctuations in the human thermometer, and especially in instruments so sensitively and delicately constructed as Mrs Varden.</s> <s sid="155" id="BR.c21.s155">Thus, at dinner Mrs V. stood at summer heat; genial, smiling, and delightful.</s> <s sid="156" id="BR.c21.s156">After dinner, in the sunshine of the wine, she went up at least half-a-dozen degrees, and was perfectly enchanting.</s> <s sid="157" id="BR.c21.s157">As its effect subsided, she fell rapidly, went to sleep for an hour or so at temperate, and woke at something below freezing.</s> <s sid="158" id="BR.c21.s158">Now she was at summer heat again, in the shade; and when tea was over, and old John, producing a bottle of cordial from one of the oaken cases, insisted on her sipping two glasses thereof in slow succession, she stood steadily at ninety for one hour and a quarter.</s> <s sid="159" id="BR.c21.s159">Profiting by experience, the locksmith took advantage of this genial weather to smoke his pipe in the porch, and in consequence of this prudent management, he was fully prepared, when the glass went down again, to start homewards directly.</s> </p>

<p pid="63" id="BR.c21.p63"><s sid="160" id="BR.c21.s160">The horse was accordingly put in, and the chaise brought round to the door.</s> <s sid="161" id="BR.c21.s161">Joe, who would on no account be dissuaded from escorting them until they had passed the most dreary and solitary part of the road, led out the grey mare at the same time; and having helped Dolly into her seat (more happiness!) sprung gaily into the saddle.</s> <s sid="162" id="BR.c21.s162">Then, after many good nights, and admonitions to wrap up, and glancing of lights, and handing in of cloaks and shawls, the chaise rolled away, and Joe trotted beside it--on Dolly's side, no doubt, and pretty close to the wheel too.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="BR.c22.p1"><s sid="1" id="BR.c22.s1">It was a fine bright night, and for all her lowness of spirits Dolly kept looking up at the stars in a manner so bewitching (and SHE knew it!) that Joe was clean out of his senses, and plainly showed that if ever a man were--not to say over head and ears, but over the Monument and the top of Saint Paul's in love, that man was himself.</s> <s sid="2" id="BR.c22.s2">The road was a very good one; not at all a jolting road, or an uneven one; and yet Dolly held the side of the chaise with one little hand, all the way.</s> <s sid="3" id="BR.c22.s3">If there had been an executioner behind him with an uplifted axe ready to chop off his head if he touched that hand, Joe couldn't have helped doing it.</s> <s sid="4" id="BR.c22.s4">From putting his own hand upon it as if by chance, and taking it away again after a minute or so, he got to riding along without taking it off at all; as if he, the escort, were bound to do that as an important part of his duty, and had come out for the purpose.</s> <s sid="5" id="BR.c22.s5">The most curious circumstance about this little incident was, that Dolly didn't seem to know of it.</s> <s sid="6" id="BR.c22.s6">She looked so innocent and unconscious when she turned her eyes on Joe, that it was quite provoking.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c22.p2"><s sid="7" id="BR.c22.s7">She talked though; talked about her fright, and about Joe's coming up to rescue her, and about her gratitude, and about her fear that she might not have thanked him enough, and about their always being friends from that time forth--and about all that sort of thing.</s> <s sid="8" id="BR.c22.s8">And when Joe said, not friends he hoped, Dolly was quite surprised, and said not enemies she hoped; and when Joe said, couldn't they be something much better than either, Dolly all of a sudden found out a star which was brighter than all the other stars, and begged to call his attention to the same, and was ten thousand times more innocent and unconscious than ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="BR.c22.p21"><s sid="51" id="BR.c22.s51">At first sight of this phenomenon (for Dolly was by no means accustomed to displays of this sort, rather learning from her mother's example to avoid them as much as possible) Mrs Varden expressed her belief that never was any woman so beset as she; that her life was a continued scene of trial; that whenever she was disposed to be well and cheerful, so sure were the people around her to throw, by some means or other, a damp upon her spirits; and that, as she had enjoyed herself that day, and Heaven knew it was very seldom she did enjoy herself so she was now to pay the penalty.</s> <s sid="52" id="BR.c22.s52">To all such propositions Miggs assented freely.</s> <s sid="53" id="BR.c22.s53">Poor Dolly, however, grew none the better for these restoratives, but rather worse, indeed; and seeing that she was really ill, both Mrs Varden and Miggs were moved to compassion, and tended her in earnest.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="BR.c22.p22"><s sid="54" id="BR.c22.s54">But even then, their very kindness shaped itself into their usual course of policy, and though Dolly was in a swoon, it was rendered clear to the meanest capacity, that Mrs Varden was the sufferer.</s> <s sid="55" id="BR.c22.s55">Thus when Dolly began to get a little better, and passed into that stage in which matrons hold that remonstrance and argument may be successfully applied, her mother represented to her, with tears in her eyes, that if she had been flurried and worried that day, she must remember it was the common lot of humanity, and in especial of womankind, who through the whole of their existence must expect no less, and were bound to make up their minds to meek endurance and patient resignation.</s> <s sid="56" id="BR.c22.s56">Mrs Varden entreated her to remember that one of these days she would, in all probability, have to do violence to her feelings so far as to be married; and that marriage, as she might see every day of her life (and truly she did) was a state requiring great fortitude and forbearance.</s> <s sid="57" id="BR.c22.s57">She represented to her in lively colours, that if she (Mrs V.) had not, in steering her course through this vale of tears, been supported by a strong principle of duty which alone upheld and prevented her from drooping, she must have been in her grave many years ago; in which case she desired to know what would have become of that errant spirit (meaning the locksmith), of whose eye she was the very apple, and in whose path she was, as it were, a shining light and guiding star?</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="BR.c22.p23"><s sid="58" id="BR.c22.s58">Miss Miggs also put in her word to the same effect.</s> <s sid="59" id="BR.c22.s59">She said that indeed and indeed Miss Dolly might take pattern by her blessed mother, who, she always had said, and always would say, though she were to be hanged, drawn, and quartered for it next minute, was the mildest, amiablest, forgivingest-spirited, longest-sufferingest female as ever she could have believed; the mere narration of whose excellencies had worked such a wholesome change in the mind of her own sister-in-law, that, whereas, before, she and her husband lived like cat and dog, and were in the habit of exchanging brass candlesticks, pot-lids, flat-irons, and other such strong resentments, they were now the happiest and affectionatest couple upon earth; as could be proved any day on application at Golden Lion Court, number twenty-sivin, second bell-handle on the right- hand doorpost.</s> <s sid="60" id="BR.c22.s60">After glancing at herself as a comparatively worthless vessel, but still as one of some desert, she besought her to bear in mind that her aforesaid dear and only mother was of a weakly constitution and excitable temperament, who had constantly to sustain afflictions in domestic life, compared with which thieves and robbers were as nothing, and yet never sunk down or gave way to despair or wrath, but, in prize-fighting phraseology, always came up to time with a cheerful countenance, and went in to win as if nothing had happened.</s> <s sid="61" id="BR.c22.s61">When Miggs finished her solo, her mistress struck in again, and the two together performed a duet to the same purpose; the burden being, that Mrs Varden was persecuted perfection, and Mr Varden, as the representative of mankind in that apartment, a creature of vicious and brutal habits, utterly insensible to the blessings he enjoyed.</s> <s sid="62" id="BR.c22.s62">Of so refined a character, indeed, was their talent of assault under the mask of sympathy, that when Dolly, recovering, embraced her father tenderly, as in vindication of his goodness, Mrs Varden expressed her solemn hope that this would be a lesson to him for the remainder of his life, and that he would do some little justice to a woman's nature ever afterwards--in which aspiration Miss Miggs, by divers sniffs and coughs, more significant than the longest oration, expressed her entire concurrence.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="BR.c22.p24"><s sid="63" id="BR.c22.s63">But the great joy of Miggs's heart was, that she not only picked up a full account of what had happened, but had the exquisite delight of conveying it to Mr Tappertit for his jealousy and torture.</s> <s sid="64" id="BR.c22.s64">For that gentleman, on account of Dolly's indisposition, had been requested to take his supper in the workshop, and it was conveyed thither by Miss Miggs's own fair hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c30.p2"><s sid="3" id="BR.c30.s3">Old John having long encroached a good standard inch, full measure, on the liberty of Joe, and having snipped off a Flemish ell in the matter of the parole, grew so despotic and so great, that his thirst for conquest knew no bounds.</s> <s sid="4" id="BR.c30.s4">The more young Joe submitted, the more absolute old John became.</s> <s sid="5" id="BR.c30.s5">The ell soon faded into nothing.</s> <s sid="6" id="BR.c30.s6">Yards, furlongs, miles arose; and on went old John in the pleasantest manner possible, trimming off an exuberance in this place, shearing away some liberty of speech or action in that, and conducting himself in his small way with as much high mightiness and majesty, as the most glorious tyrant that ever had his statue reared in the public ways, of ancient or of modern times.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BR.c30.p3"><s sid="7" id="BR.c30.s7">As great men are urged on to the abuse of power (when they need urging, which is not often), by their flatterers and dependents, so old John was impelled to these exercises of authority by the applause and admiration of his Maypole cronies, who, in the intervals of their nightly pipes and pots, would shake their heads and say that Mr Willet was a father of the good old English sort; that there were no new-fangled notions or modern ways in him; that he put them in mind of what their fathers were when they were boys; that there was no mistake about him; that it would be well for the country if there were more like him, and more was the pity that there were not; with many other original remarks of that nature.</s> <s sid="8" id="BR.c30.s8">Then they would condescendingly give Joe to understand that it was all for his good, and he would be thankful for it one day; and in particular, Mr Cobb would acquaint him, that when he was his age, his father thought no more of giving him a parental kick, or a box on the ears, or a cuff on the head, or some little admonition of that sort, than he did of any other ordinary duty of life; and he would further remark, with looks of great significance, that but for this judicious bringing up, he might have never been the man he was at that present speaking; which was probable enough, as he was, beyond all question, the dullest dog of the party.</s> <s sid="9" id="BR.c30.s9">In short, between old John and old John's friends, there never was an unfortunate young fellow so bullied, badgered, worried, fretted, and brow-beaten; so constantly beset, or made so tired of his life, as poor Joe Willet.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c31.p2"><s sid="3" id="BR.c31.s3">It came on darker and darker.</s> <s sid="4" id="BR.c31.s4">The old-fashioned furniture of the chamber, which was a kind of hospital for all the invalided movables in the house, grew indistinct and shadowy in its many shapes; chairs and tables, which by day were as honest cripples as need be, assumed a doubtful and mysterious character; and one old leprous screen of faded India leather and gold binding, which had kept out many a cold breath of air in days of yore and shut in many a jolly face, frowned on him with a spectral aspect, and stood at full height in its allotted corner, like some gaunt ghost who waited to be questioned.</s> <s sid="5" id="BR.c31.s5">A portrait opposite the window--a queer, old grey-eyed general, in an oval frame--seemed to wink and doze as the light decayed, and at length, when the last faint glimmering speck of day went out, to shut its eyes in good earnest, and fall sound asleep.</s> <s sid="6" id="BR.c31.s6">There was such a hush and mystery about everything, that Joe could not help following its example; and so went off into a slumber likewise, and dreamed of Dolly, till the clock of Chigwell church struck two.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BR.c31.p3"><s sid="7" id="BR.c31.s7">Still nobody came.</s> <s sid="8" id="BR.c31.s8">The distant noises in the house had ceased, and out of doors all was quiet; save for the occasional barking of some deep-mouthed dog, and the shaking of the branches by the night wind.</s> <s sid="9" id="BR.c31.s9">He gazed mournfully out of window at each well-known object as it lay sleeping in the dim light of the moon; and creeping back to his former seat, thought about the late uproar, until, with long thinking of, it seemed to have occurred a month ago.</s> <s sid="10" id="BR.c31.s10">Thus, between dozing, and thinking, and walking to the window and looking out, the night wore away; the grim old screen, and the kindred chairs and tables, began slowly to reveal themselves in their accustomed forms; the grey-eyed general seemed to wink and yawn and rouse himself; and at last he was broad awake again, and very uncomfortable and cold and haggard he looked, in the dull grey light of morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BR.c31.p4"><s sid="11" id="BR.c31.s11">The sun had begun to peep above the forest trees, and already flung across the curling mist bright bars of gold, when Joe dropped from his window on the ground below, a little bundle and his trusty stick, and prepared to descend himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BR.c31.p5"><s sid="12" id="BR.c31.s12">It was not a very difficult task; for there were so many projections and gable ends in the way, that they formed a series of clumsy steps, with no greater obstacle than a jump of some few feet at last.</s> <s sid="13" id="BR.c31.s13">Joe, with his stick and bundle on his shoulder, quickly stood on the firm earth, and looked up at the old Maypole, it might be for the last time.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="BR.c31.p8"><s sid="18" id="BR.c31.s18">It was only eight o'clock then, and very much astonished the Black Lion was, to see him come walking in with dust upon his feet at that early hour, with no grey mare to bear him company.</s> <s sid="19" id="BR.c31.s19">But as he ordered breakfast to be got ready with all speed, and on its being set before him gave indisputable tokens of a hearty appetite, the Lion received him, as usual, with a hospitable welcome; and treated him with those marks of distinction, which, as a regular customer, and one within the freemasonry of the trade, he had a right to claim.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BR.c37.p1"><s sid="1" id="BR.c37.s1">To surround anything, however monstrous or ridiculous, with an air of mystery, is to invest it with a secret charm, and power of attraction which to the crowd is irresistible.</s> <s sid="2" id="BR.c37.s2">False priests, false prophets, false doctors, false patriots, false prodigies of every kind, veiling their proceedings in mystery, have always addressed themselves at an immense advantage to the popular credulity, and have been, perhaps, more indebted to that resource in gaining and keeping for a time the upper hand of Truth and Common Sense, than to any half-dozen items in the whole catalogue of imposture.</s> <s sid="3" id="BR.c37.s3">Curiosity is, and has been from the creation of the world, a master-passion.</s> <s sid="4" id="BR.c37.s4">To awaken it, to gratify it by slight degrees, and yet leave something always in suspense, is to establish the surest hold that can be had, in wrong, on the unthinking portion of mankind.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c37.p2"><s sid="5" id="BR.c37.s5">If a man had stood on London Bridge, calling till he was hoarse, upon the passers-by, to join with Lord George Gordon, although for an object which no man understood, and which in that very incident had a charm of its own,--the probability is, that he might have influenced a score of people in a month.</s> <s sid="6" id="BR.c37.s6">If all zealous Protestants had been publicly urged to join an association for the avowed purpose of singing a hymn or two occasionally, and hearing some indifferent speeches made, and ultimately of petitioning Parliament not to pass an act for abolishing the penal laws against Roman Catholic priests, the penalty of perpetual imprisonment denounced against those who educated children in that persuasion, and the disqualification of all members of the Romish church to inherit real property in the United Kingdom by right of purchase or descent,--matters so far removed from the business and bosoms of the mass, might perhaps have called together a hundred people.</s> <s sid="7" id="BR.c37.s7">But when vague rumours got abroad, that in this Protestant association a secret power was mustering against the government for undefined and mighty purposes; when the air was filled with whispers of a confederacy among the Popish powers to degrade and enslave England, establish an inquisition in London, and turn the pens of Smithfield market into stakes and cauldrons; when terrors and alarms which no man understood were perpetually broached, both in and out of Parliament, by one enthusiast who did not understand himself, and bygone bugbears which had lain quietly in their graves for centuries, were raised again to haunt the ignorant and credulous; when all this was done, as it were, in the dark, and secret invitations to join the Great Protestant Association in defence of religion, life, and liberty, were dropped in the public ways, thrust under the house-doors, tossed in at windows, and pressed into the hands of those who trod the streets by night; when they glared from every wall, and shone on every post and pillar, so that stocks and stones appeared infected with the common fear, urging all men to join together blindfold in resistance of they knew not what, they knew not why;--then the mania spread indeed, and the body, still increasing every day, grew forty thousand strong.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="BR.c38.p27"><s sid="60" id="BR.c38.s60">The enrolment being completed, and Hugh having been informed by Gashford, in his peculiar manner, of the peaceful and strictly lawful objects contemplated by the body to which he now belonged-- during which recital Mr Dennis nudged him very much with his elbow, and made divers remarkable faces--the secretary gave them both to understand that he desired to be alone.</s> <s sid="61" id="BR.c38.s61">Therefore they took their leaves without delay, and came out of the house together.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="BR.c38.p32"><s sid="70" id="BR.c38.s70">He told him, too, who some of the Lords and Commons were, by name, as they came in and out; whether they were friendly to the Papists or otherwise; and bade him take notice of their liveries and equipages, that he might be sure of them, in case of need.</s> <s sid="71" id="BR.c38.s71">Sometimes he drew him close to the windows of a passing carriage, that he might see its master's face by the light of the lamps; and, both in respect of people and localities, he showed so much acquaintance with everything around, that it was plain he had often studied there before; as indeed, when they grew a little more confidential, he confessed he had.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="BR.c38.p33"><s sid="72" id="BR.c38.s72">Perhaps the most striking part of all this was, the number of people--never in groups of more than two or three together--who seemed to be skulking about the crowd for the same purpose.</s> <s sid="73" id="BR.c38.s73">To the greater part of these, a slight nod or a look from Hugh's companion was sufficient greeting; but, now and then, some man would come and stand beside him in the throng, and, without turning his head or appearing to communicate with him, would say a word or two in a low voice, which he would answer in the same cautious manner.</s> <s sid="74" id="BR.c38.s74">Then they would part, like strangers.</s> <s sid="75" id="BR.c38.s75">Some of these men often reappeared again unexpectedly in the crowd close to Hugh, and, as they passed by, pressed his hand, or looked him sternly in the face; but they never spoke to him, nor he to them; no, not a word.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="BR.c38.p34"><s sid="76" id="BR.c38.s76">It was remarkable, too, that whenever they happened to stand where there was any press of people, and Hugh chanced to be looking downward, he was sure to see an arm stretched out--under his own perhaps, or perhaps across him--which thrust some paper into the hand or pocket of a bystander, and was so suddenly withdrawn that it was impossible to tell from whom it came; nor could he see in any face, on glancing quickly round, the least confusion or surprise.</s> <s sid="77" id="BR.c38.s77">They often trod upon a paper like the one he carried in his breast, but his companion whispered him not to touch it or to take it up,--not even to look towards it,--so there they let them lie, and passed on.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="BR.c38.p35" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="BR.c38.s78">When they had paraded the street and all the avenues of the building in this manner for near two hours, they turned away, and his friend asked him what he thought of what he had seen, and whether he was prepared for a good hot piece of work if it should come to that.</s> <s sid="79" id="BR.c38.s79">The hotter the better,' said Hugh, <qs/>'I'm prepared for anything.'<qe/>--'So am I,' said his friend, 'and so are many of us; and they shook hands upon it with a great oath, and with many terrible imprecations on the Papists.</s> </p><p pid="36" id="BR.c38.p36"><s sid="80" id="BR.c38.s80">As they were thirsty by this time, Dennis proposed that they should repair together to The Boot, where there was good company and strong liquor.</s> <s sid="81" id="BR.c38.s81">Hugh yielding a ready assent, they bent their steps that way with no loss of time.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="BR.c38.p37"><s sid="82" id="BR.c38.s82">This Boot was a lone house of public entertainment, situated in the fields at the back of the Foundling Hospital; a very solitary spot at that period, and quite deserted after dark.</s> <s sid="83" id="BR.c38.s83">The tavern stood at some distance from any high road, and was approachable only by a dark and narrow lane; so that Hugh was much surprised to find several people drinking there, and great merriment going on.</s> <s sid="84" id="BR.c38.s84">He was still more surprised to find among them almost every face that had caught his attention in the crowd; but his companion having whispered him outside the door, that it was not considered good manners at The Boot to appear at all curious about the company, he kept his own counsel, and made no show of recognition.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="BR.c38.p38"><s sid="85" id="BR.c38.s85">Before putting his lips to the liquor which was brought for them, Dennis drank in a loud voice the health of Lord George Gordon, President of the Great Protestant Association; which toast Hugh pledged likewise, with corresponding enthusiasm.</s> <s sid="86" id="BR.c38.s86">A fiddler who was present, and who appeared to act as the appointed minstrel of the company, forthwith struck up a Scotch reel; and that in tones so invigorating, that Hugh and his friend (who had both been drinking before) rose from their seats as by previous concert, and, to the great admiration of the assembled guests, performed an extemporaneous No-Popery Dance.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="BR.c39.p1"><s sid="1" id="BR.c39.s1">The applause which the performance of Hugh and his new friend elicited from the company at The Boot, had not yet subsided, and the two dancers were still panting from their exertions, which had been of a rather extreme and violent character, when the party was reinforced by the arrival of some more guests, who, being a detachment of United Bulldogs, were received with very flattering marks of distinction and respect.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c39.p2"><s sid="2" id="BR.c39.s2">The leader of this small party--for, including himself, they were but three in number--was our old acquaintance, Mr Tappertit, who seemed, physically speaking, to have grown smaller with years (particularly as to his legs, which were stupendously little), but who, in a moral point of view, in personal dignity and self-esteem, had swelled into a giant.</s> <s sid="3" id="BR.c39.s3">Nor was it by any means difficult for the most unobservant person to detect this state of feeling in the quondam 'prentice, for it not only proclaimed itself impressively and beyond mistake in his majestic walk and kindling eye, but found a striking means of revelation in his turned-up nose, which scouted all things of earth with deep disdain, and sought communion with its kindred skies.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BR.c39.p3"><s sid="4" id="BR.c39.s4">Mr Tappertit, as chief or captain of the Bulldogs, was attended by his two lieutenants; one, the tall comrade of his younger life; the other, a 'Prentice Knight in days of yore--Mark Gilbert, bound in the olden time to Thomas Curzon of the Golden Fleece.</s> <s sid="5" id="BR.c39.s5">These gentlemen, like himself, were now emancipated from their 'prentice thraldom, and served as journeymen; but they were, in humble emulation of his great example, bold and daring spirits, and aspired to a distinguished state in great political events.</s> <s sid="6" id="BR.c39.s6">Hence their connection with the Protestant Association of England, sanctioned by the name of Lord George Gordon; and hence their present visit to The Boot.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="BR.c42.p29"><s sid="75" id="BR.c42.s75">As they looked about them on the decaying furniture, it was strange to find how vividly it presented those to whom it had belonged, and with whom it was once familiar.</s> <s sid="76" id="BR.c42.s76">Grip seemed to perch again upon his high-backed chair; Barnaby to crouch in his old favourite corner by the fire; the mother to resume her usual seat, and watch him as of old.</s> <s sid="77" id="BR.c42.s77">Even when they could separate these objects from the phantoms of the mind which they invoked, the latter only glided out of sight, but lingered near them still; for then they seemed to lurk in closets and behind the doors, ready to start out and suddenly accost them in well-remembered tones.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BR.c43.p1"><s sid="1" id="BR.c43.s1">Next morning brought no satisfaction to the locksmith's thoughts, nor next day, nor the next, nor many others.</s> <s sid="2" id="BR.c43.s2">Often after nightfall he entered the street, and turned his eyes towards the well-known house; and as surely as he did so, there was the solitary light, still gleaming through the crevices of the window-shutter, while all within was motionless, noiseless, cheerless, as a grave.</s> <s sid="3" id="BR.c43.s3">Unwilling to hazard Mr Haredale's favour by disobeying his strict injunction, he never ventured to knock at the door or to make his presence known in any way.</s> <s sid="4" id="BR.c43.s4">But whenever strong interest and curiosity attracted him to the spot--which was not seldom--the light was always there.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c43.p2"><s sid="5" id="BR.c43.s5">If he could have known what passed within, the knowledge would have yielded him no clue to this mysterious vigil.</s> <s sid="6" id="BR.c43.s6">At twilight, Mr Haredale shut himself up, and at daybreak he came forth.</s> <s sid="7" id="BR.c43.s7">He never missed a night, always came and went alone, and never varied his proceedings in the least degree.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BR.c43.p3"><s sid="8" id="BR.c43.s8">The manner of his watch was this.</s> <s sid="9" id="BR.c43.s9">At dusk, he entered the house in the same way as when the locksmith bore him company, kindled a light, went through the rooms, and narrowly examined them.</s> <s sid="10" id="BR.c43.s10">That done, he returned to the chamber on the ground-floor, and laying his sword and pistols on the table, sat by it until morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BR.c43.p4"><s sid="11" id="BR.c43.s11">He usually had a book with him, and often tried to read, but never fixed his eyes or thoughts upon it for five minutes together.</s> <s sid="12" id="BR.c43.s12">The slightest noise without doors, caught his ear; a step upon the pavement seemed to make his heart leap.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BR.c43.p5"><s sid="13" id="BR.c43.s13">He was not without some refreshment during the long lonely hours; generally carrying in his pocket a sandwich of bread and meat, and a small flask of wine.</s> <s sid="14" id="BR.c43.s14">The latter diluted with large quantities of water, he drank in a heated, feverish way, as though his throat were dried; but he scarcely ever broke his fast, by so much as a crumb of bread.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="BR.c43.p6"><s sid="15" id="BR.c43.s15">If this voluntary sacrifice of sleep and comfort had its origin, as the locksmith on consideration was disposed to think, in any superstitious expectation of the fulfilment of a dream or vision connected with the event on which he had brooded for so many years, and if he waited for some ghostly visitor who walked abroad when men lay sleeping in their beds, he showed no trace of fear or wavering.</s> <s sid="16" id="BR.c43.s16">His stern features expressed inflexible resolution; his brows were puckered, and his lips compressed, with deep and settled purpose; and when he started at a noise and listened, it was not with the start of fear but hope, and catching up his sword as though the hour had come at last, he would clutch it in his tight- clenched hand, and listen with sparkling eyes and eager looks, until it died away.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="BR.c43.p7"><s sid="17" id="BR.c43.s17">These disappointments were numerous, for they ensued on almost every sound, but his constancy was not shaken.</s> <s sid="18" id="BR.c43.s18">Still, every night he was at his post, the same stern, sleepless, sentinel; and still night passed, and morning dawned, and he must watch again.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="BR.c43.p8"><s sid="19" id="BR.c43.s19">This went on for weeks; he had taken a lodging at Vauxhall in which to pass the day and rest himself; and from this place, when the tide served, he usually came to London Bridge from Westminster by water, in order that he might avoid the busy streets.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="BR.c43.p9"><s sid="20" id="BR.c43.s20">One evening, shortly before twilight, he came his accustomed road upon the river's bank, intending to pass through Westminster Hall into Palace Yard, and there take boat to London Bridge as usual.</s> <s sid="21" id="BR.c43.s21">There was a pretty large concourse of people assembled round the Houses of Parliament, looking at the members as they entered and departed, and giving vent to rather noisy demonstrations of approval or dislike, according to their known opinions.</s> <s sid="22" id="BR.c43.s22">As he made his way among the throng, he heard once or twice the No-Popery cry, which was then becoming pretty familiar to the ears of most men; but holding it in very slight regard, and observing that the idlers were of the lowest grade, he neither thought nor cared about it, but made his way along, with perfect indifference.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="BR.c43.p10"><s sid="23" id="BR.c43.s23">There were many little knots and groups of persons in Westminster Hall: some few looking upward at its noble ceiling, and at the rays of evening light, tinted by the setting sun, which streamed in aslant through its small windows, and growing dimmer by degrees, were quenched in the gathering gloom below; some, noisy passengers, mechanics going home from work, and otherwise, who hurried quickly through, waking the echoes with their voices, and soon darkening the small door in the distance, as they passed into the street beyond; some, in busy conference together on political or private matters, pacing slowly up and down with eyes that sought the ground, and seeming, by their attitudes, to listen earnestly from head to foot.</s> <s sid="24" id="BR.c43.s24">Here, a dozen squabbling urchins made a very Babel in the air; there, a solitary man, half clerk, half mendicant, paced up and down with hungry dejection in his look and gait; at his elbow passed an errand-lad, swinging his basket round and round, and with his shrill whistle riving the very timbers of the roof; while a more observant schoolboy, half-way through, pocketed his ball, and eyed the distant beadle as he came looming on.</s> <s sid="25" id="BR.c43.s25">It was that time of evening when, if you shut your eyes and open them again, the darkness of an hour appears to have gathered in a second.</s> <s sid="26" id="BR.c43.s26">The smooth-worn pavement, dusty with footsteps, still called upon the lofty walls to reiterate the shuffle and the tread of feet unceasingly, save when the closing of some heavy door resounded through the building like a clap of thunder, and drowned all other noises in its rolling sound.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="BR.c43.p11"><s sid="27" id="BR.c43.s27">Mr Haredale, glancing only at such of these groups as he passed nearest to, and then in a manner betokening that his thoughts were elsewhere, had nearly traversed the Hall, when two persons before him caught his attention.</s> <s sid="28" id="BR.c43.s28">One of these, a gentleman in elegant attire, carried in his hand a cane, which he twirled in a jaunty manner as he loitered on; the other, an obsequious, crouching, fawning figure, listened to what he said--at times throwing in a humble word himself--and, with his shoulders shrugged up to his ears, rubbed his hands submissively, or answered at intervals by an inclination of the head, half-way between a nod of acquiescence, and a bow of most profound respect.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="BR.c43.p12"><s sid="29" id="BR.c43.s29">In the abstract there was nothing very remarkable in this pair, for servility waiting on a handsome suit of clothes and a cane--not to speak of gold and silver sticks, or wands of office--is common enough.</s> <s sid="30" id="BR.c43.s30">But there was that about the well-dressed man, yes, and about the other likewise, which struck Mr Haredale with no pleasant feeling.</s> <s sid="31" id="BR.c43.s31">He hesitated, stopped, and would have stepped aside and turned out of his path, but at the moment, the other two faced about quickly, and stumbled upon him before he could avoid them.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BR.c53.p1"><s sid="1" id="BR.c53.s1">The next day was ushered in by merry peals of bells, and by the firing of the Tower guns; flags were hoisted on many of the church- steeples; the usual demonstrations were made in honour of the anniversary of the King's birthday; and every man went about his pleasure or business as if the city were in perfect order, and there were no half-smouldering embers in its secret places, which, on the approach of night, would kindle up again and scatter ruin and dismay abroad.</s> <s sid="2" id="BR.c53.s2">The leaders of the riot, rendered still more daring by the success of last night and by the booty they had acquired, kept steadily together, and only thought of implicating the mass of their followers so deeply that no hope of pardon or reward might tempt them to betray their more notorious confederates into the hands of justice.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BR.c55.p1"><s sid="1" id="BR.c55.s1">John Willet, left alone in his dismantled bar, continued to sit staring about him; awake as to his eyes, certainly, but with all his powers of reason and reflection in a sound and dreamless sleep.</s> <s sid="2" id="BR.c55.s2">He looked round upon the room which had been for years, and was within an hour ago, the pride of his heart; and not a muscle of his face was moved.</s> <s sid="3" id="BR.c55.s3">The night, without, looked black and cold through the dreary gaps in the casement; the precious liquids, now nearly leaked away, dripped with a hollow sound upon the floor; the Maypole peered ruefully in through the broken window, like the bowsprit of a wrecked ship; the ground might have been the bottom of the sea, it was so strewn with precious fragments.</s> <s sid="4" id="BR.c55.s4">Currents of air rushed in, as the old doors jarred and creaked upon their hinges; the candles flickered and guttered down, and made long winding-sheets; the cheery deep-red curtains flapped and fluttered idly in the wind; even the stout Dutch kegs, overthrown and lying empty in dark corners, seemed the mere husks of good fellows whose jollity had departed, and who could kindle with a friendly glow no more.</s> <s sid="5" id="BR.c55.s5">John saw this desolation, and yet saw it not.</s> <s sid="6" id="BR.c55.s6">He was perfectly contented to sit there, staring at it, and felt no more indignation or discomfort in his bonds than if they had been robes of honour.</s> <s sid="7" id="BR.c55.s7">So far as he was personally concerned, old Time lay snoring, and the world stood still.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c55.p2"><s sid="8" id="BR.c55.s8">Save for the dripping from the barrels, the rustling of such light fragments of destruction as the wind affected, and the dull creaking of the open doors, all was profoundly quiet: indeed, these sounds, like the ticking of the death-watch in the night, only made the silence they invaded deeper and more apparent.</s> <s sid="9" id="BR.c55.s9">But quiet or noisy, it was all one to John.</s> <s sid="10" id="BR.c55.s10">If a train of heavy artillery could have come up and commenced ball practice outside the window, it would have been all the same to him.</s> <s sid="11" id="BR.c55.s11">He was a long way beyond surprise.</s> <s sid="12" id="BR.c55.s12">A ghost couldn't have overtaken him.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BR.c55.p3"><s sid="13" id="BR.c55.s13">By and by he heard a footstep--a hurried, and yet cautious footstep--coming on towards the house.</s> <s sid="14" id="BR.c55.s14">It stopped, advanced again, then seemed to go quite round it.</s> <s sid="15" id="BR.c55.s15">Having done that, it came beneath the window, and a head looked in.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BR.c55.p4"><s sid="16" id="BR.c55.s16">It was strongly relieved against the darkness outside by the glare of the guttering candles.</s> <s sid="17" id="BR.c55.s17">A pale, worn, withered face; the eyes-- but that was owing to its gaunt condition--unnaturally large and bright; the hair, a grizzled black.</s> <s sid="18" id="BR.c55.s18">It gave a searching glance all round the room, and a deep voice said:</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BR.c55.p5" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="BR.c55.s19"><qs/>'Are you alone in this house?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="BR.c55.p6"><s sid="20" id="BR.c55.s20">John made no sign, though the question was repeated twice, and he heard it distinctly.</s> <s sid="21" id="BR.c55.s21">After a moment's pause, the man got in at the window.</s> <s sid="22" id="BR.c55.s22">John was not at all surprised at this, either.</s> <s sid="23" id="BR.c55.s23">There had been so much getting in and out of window in the course of the last hour or so, that he had quite forgotten the door, and seemed to have lived among such exercises from infancy.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="BR.c55.p7"><s sid="24" id="BR.c55.s24">The man wore a large, dark, faded cloak, and a slouched hat; he walked up close to John, and looked at him.</s> <s sid="25" id="BR.c55.s25">John returned the compliment with interest.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="BR.c55.p8" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="BR.c55.s26"><qs/>'How long have you been sitting thus?'<qe/> said the man.</s> </p><p pid="9" id="BR.c55.p9"><s sid="27" id="BR.c55.s27">John considered, but nothing came of it.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="BR.c55.p10" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="BR.c55.s28"><qs/>'Which way have the party gone?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="BR.c55.p11"><s sid="29" id="BR.c55.s29">Some wandering speculations relative to the fashion of the stranger's boots, got into Mr Willet's mind by some accident or other, but they got out again in a hurry, and left him in his former state.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="BR.c55.p12" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="BR.c55.s30"><qs/>'You would do well to speak,'<qe/><sss/> said the man; <sse/><qs/>'you may keep a whole skin, though you have nothing else left that can be hurt.</s> <s sid="31" id="BR.c55.s31">Which way have the party gone?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="BR.c55.p13" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="BR.c55.s32"><qs/>'That!'<qe/> said John, finding his voice all at once, and nodding with perfect good faith--he couldn't point; he was so tightly bound--in exactly the opposite direction to the right one.</s> </p><p pid="14" id="BR.c55.p14" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="BR.c55.s33"><qs/>'You lie!'<qe/> said the man angrily, and with a threatening gesture.</s> <s sid="34" id="BR.c55.s34"><qs/>'I came that way.</s> <s sid="35" id="BR.c55.s35">You would betray me.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="BR.c55.p15"><s sid="36" id="BR.c55.s36">It was so evident that John's imperturbability was not assumed, but was the result of the late proceedings under his roof, that the man stayed his hand in the very act of striking him, and turned away.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="BR.c55.p16"><s sid="37" id="BR.c55.s37">John looked after him without so much as a twitch in a single nerve of his face.</s> <s sid="38" id="BR.c55.s38">He seized a glass, and holding it under one of the little casks until a few drops were collected, drank them greedily off; then throwing it down upon the floor impatiently, he took the vessel in his hands and drained it into his throat.</s> <s sid="39" id="BR.c55.s39">Some scraps of bread and meat were scattered about, and on these he fell next; eating them with voracity, and pausing every now and then to listen for some fancied noise outside.</s> <s sid="40" id="BR.c55.s40">When he had refreshed himself in this manner with violent haste, and raised another barrel to his lips, he pulled his hat upon his brow as though he were about to leave the house, and turned to John.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="BR.c55.p17" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="BR.c55.s41"><qs/>'Where are your servants?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="18" id="BR.c55.p18" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="BR.c55.s42">Mr Willet indistinctly remembered to have heard the rioters calling to them to throw the key of the room in which they were, out of window, for their keeping.</s> <s sid="43" id="BR.c55.s43">He therefore replied, <qs/>'Locked up.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="BR.c55.p19" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="BR.c55.s44"><qs/>'Well for them if they remain quiet, and well for you if you do the like,'<qe/> said the man.</s> <s sid="45" id="BR.c55.s45"><qs/>'Now show me the way the party went.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="20" id="BR.c55.p20"><s sid="46" id="BR.c55.s46">This time Mr Willet indicated it correctly.</s> <s sid="47" id="BR.c55.s47">The man was hurrying to the door, when suddenly there came towards them on the wind, the loud and rapid tolling of an alarm-bell, and then a bright and vivid glare streamed up, which illumined, not only the whole chamber, but all the country.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="BR.c55.p21"><s sid="48" id="BR.c55.s48">It was not the sudden change from darkness to this dreadful light, it was not the sound of distant shrieks and shouts of triumph, it was not this dread invasion of the serenity and peace of night, that drove the man back as though a thunderbolt had struck him.</s> <s sid="49" id="BR.c55.s49">It was the Bell.</s> <s sid="50" id="BR.c55.s50">If the ghastliest shape the human mind has ever pictured in its wildest dreams had risen up before him, he could not have staggered backward from its touch, as he did from the first sound of that loud iron voice.</s> <s sid="51" id="BR.c55.s51">With eyes that started from his head, his limbs convulsed, his face most horrible to see, he raised one arm high up into the air, and holding something visionary back and down, with his other hand, drove at it as though he held a knife and stabbed it to the heart.</s> <s sid="52" id="BR.c55.s52">He clutched his hair, and stopped his ears, and travelled madly round and round; then gave a frightful cry, and with it rushed away: still, still, the Bell tolled on and seemed to follow him--louder and louder, hotter and hotter yet.</s> <s sid="53" id="BR.c55.s53">The glare grew brighter, the roar of voices deeper; the crash of heavy bodies falling, shook the air; bright streams of sparks rose up into the sky; but louder than them all-- rising faster far, to Heaven--a million times more fierce and furious--pouring forth dreadful secrets after its long silence-- speaking the language of the dead--the Bell--the Bell!</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="BR.c55.p22"><s sid="54" id="BR.c55.s54">What hunt of spectres could surpass that dread pursuit and flight!</s> <s sid="55" id="BR.c55.s55">Had there been a legion of them on his track, he could have better borne it.</s> <s sid="56" id="BR.c55.s56">They would have had a beginning and an end, but here all space was full.</s> <s sid="57" id="BR.c55.s57">The one pursuing voice was everywhere: it sounded in the earth, the air; shook the long grass, and howled among the trembling trees.</s> <s sid="58" id="BR.c55.s58">The echoes caught it up, the owls hooted as it flew upon the breeze, the nightingale was silent and hid herself among the thickest boughs: it seemed to goad and urge the angry fire, and lash it into madness; everything was steeped in one prevailing red; the glow was everywhere; nature was drenched in blood: still the remorseless crying of that awful voice--the Bell, the Bell!</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="BR.c55.p23"><s sid="59" id="BR.c55.s59">It ceased; but not in his ears.</s> <s sid="60" id="BR.c55.s60">The knell was at his heart.</s> <s sid="61" id="BR.c55.s61">No work of man had ever voice like that which sounded there, and warned him that it cried unceasingly to Heaven.</s> <s sid="62" id="BR.c55.s62">Who could hear that hell, and not know what it said!</s> <s sid="63" id="BR.c55.s63">There was murder in its every note--cruel, relentless, savage murder--the murder of a confiding man, by one who held his every trust.</s> <s sid="64" id="BR.c55.s64">Its ringing summoned phantoms from their graves.</s> <s sid="65" id="BR.c55.s65">What face was that, in which a friendly smile changed to a look of half incredulous horror, which stiffened for a moment into one of pain, then changed again into an imploring glance at Heaven, and so fell idly down with upturned eyes, like the dead stags' he had often peeped at when a little child: shrinking and shuddering--there was a dreadful thing to think of now!--and clinging to an apron as he looked!</s> <s sid="66" id="BR.c55.s66">He sank upon the ground, and grovelling down as if he would dig himself a place to hide in, covered his face and ears: but no, no, no,--a hundred walls and roofs of brass would not shut out that bell, for in it spoke the wrathful voice of God, and from that voice, the whole wide universe could not afford a refuge!</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="BR.c55.p24"><s sid="67" id="BR.c55.s67">While he rushed up and down, not knowing where to turn, and while he lay crouching there, the work went briskly on indeed.</s> <s sid="68" id="BR.c55.s68">When they left the Maypole, the rioters formed into a solid body, and advanced at a quick pace towards the Warren.</s> <s sid="69" id="BR.c55.s69">Rumour of their approach having gone before, they found the garden-doors fast closed, the windows made secure, and the house profoundly dark: not a light being visible in any portion of the building.</s> <s sid="70" id="BR.c55.s70">After some fruitless ringing at the bells, and beating at the iron gates, they drew off a few paces to reconnoitre, and confer upon the course it would be best to take.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="BR.c55.p25"><s sid="71" id="BR.c55.s71">Very little conference was needed, when all were bent upon one desperate purpose, infuriated with liquor, and flushed with successful riot.</s> <s sid="72" id="BR.c55.s72">The word being given to surround the house, some climbed the gates, or dropped into the shallow trench and scaled the garden wall, while others pulled down the solid iron fence, and while they made a breach to enter by, made deadly weapons of the bars.</s> <s sid="73" id="BR.c55.s73">The house being completely encircled, a small number of men were despatched to break open a tool-shed in the garden; and during their absence on this errand, the remainder contented themselves with knocking violently at the doors, and calling to those within, to come down and open them on peril of their lives.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="BR.c55.p26"><s sid="74" id="BR.c55.s74">No answer being returned to this repeated summons, and the detachment who had been sent away, coming back with an accession of pickaxes, spades, and hoes, they,--together with those who had such arms already, or carried (as many did) axes, poles, and crowbars,-- struggled into the foremost rank, ready to beset the doors and windows.</s> <s sid="75" id="BR.c55.s75">They had not at this time more than a dozen lighted torches among them; but when these preparations were completed, flaming links were distributed and passed from hand to hand with such rapidity, that, in a minute's time, at least two-thirds of the whole roaring mass bore, each man in his hand, a blazing brand.</s> <s sid="76" id="BR.c55.s76">Whirling these about their heads they raised a loud shout, and fell to work upon the doors and windows.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="BR.c55.p27"><s sid="77" id="BR.c55.s77">Amidst the clattering of heavy blows, the rattling of broken glass, the cries and execrations of the mob, and all the din and turmoil of the scene, Hugh and his friends kept together at the turret-door where Mr Haredale had last admitted him and old John Willet; and spent their united force on that.</s> <s sid="78" id="BR.c55.s78">It was a strong old oaken door, guarded by good bolts and a heavy bar, but it soon went crashing in upon the narrow stairs behind, and made, as it were, a platform to facilitate their tearing up into the rooms above.</s> <s sid="79" id="BR.c55.s79">Almost at the same moment, a dozen other points were forced, and at every one the crowd poured in like water.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="BR.c55.p28"><s sid="80" id="BR.c55.s80">A few armed servant-men were posted in the hall, and when the rioters forced an entrance there, they fired some half-a-dozen shots.</s> <s sid="81" id="BR.c55.s81">But these taking no effect, and the concourse coming on like an army of devils, they only thought of consulting their own safety, and retreated, echoing their assailants' cries, and hoping in the confusion to be taken for rioters themselves; in which stratagem they succeeded, with the exception of one old man who was never heard of again, and was said to have had his brains beaten out with an iron bar (one of his fellows reported that he had seen the old man fall), and to have been afterwards burnt in the flames.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="BR.c55.p29"><s sid="82" id="BR.c55.s82">The besiegers being now in complete possession of the house, spread themselves over it from garret to cellar, and plied their demon labours fiercely.</s> <s sid="83" id="BR.c55.s83">While some small parties kindled bonfires underneath the windows, others broke up the furniture and cast the fragments down to feed the flames below; where the apertures in the wall (windows no longer) were large enough, they threw out tables, chests of drawers, beds, mirrors, pictures, and flung them whole into the fire; while every fresh addition to the blazing masses was received with shouts, and howls, and yells, which added new and dismal terrors to the conflagration.</s> <s sid="84" id="BR.c55.s84">Those who had axes and had spent their fury on the movables, chopped and tore down the doors and window frames, broke up the flooring, hewed away the rafters, and buried men who lingered in the upper rooms, in heaps of ruins.</s> <s sid="85" id="BR.c55.s85">Some searched the drawers, the chests, the boxes, writing-desks, and closets, for jewels, plate, and money; while others, less mindful of gain and more mad for destruction, cast their whole contents into the courtyard without examination, and called to those below, to heap them on the blaze.</s> <s sid="86" id="BR.c55.s86">Men who had been into the cellars, and had staved the casks, rushed to and fro stark mad, setting fire to all they saw--often to the dresses of their own friends--and kindling the building in so many parts that some had no time for escape, and were seen, with drooping hands and blackened faces, hanging senseless on the window-sills to which they had crawled, until they were sucked and drawn into the burning gulf.</s> <s sid="87" id="BR.c55.s87">The more the fire crackled and raged, the wilder and more cruel the men grew; as though moving in that element they became fiends, and changed their earthly nature for the qualities that give delight in hell.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="BR.c55.p30"><s sid="88" id="BR.c55.s88">The burning pile, revealing rooms and passages red hot, through gaps made in the crumbling walls; the tributary fires that licked the outer bricks and stones, with their long forked tongues, and ran up to meet the glowing mass within; the shining of the flames upon the villains who looked on and fed them; the roaring of the angry blaze, so bright and high that it seemed in its rapacity to have swallowed up the very smoke; the living flakes the wind bore rapidly away and hurried on with, like a storm of fiery snow; the noiseless breaking of great beams of wood, which fell like feathers on the heap of ashes, and crumbled in the very act to sparks and powder; the lurid tinge that overspread the sky, and the darkness, very deep by contrast, which prevailed around; the exposure to the coarse, common gaze, of every little nook which usages of home had made a sacred place, and the destruction by rude hands of every little household favourite which old associations made a dear and precious thing: all this taking place--not among pitying looks and friendly murmurs of compassion, but brutal shouts and exultations, which seemed to make the very rats who stood by the old house too long, creatures with some claim upon the pity and regard of those its roof had sheltered:--combined to form a scene never to be forgotten by those who saw it and were not actors in the work, so long as life endured.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="BR.c55.p31"><s sid="89" id="BR.c55.s89">And who were they?</s> <s sid="90" id="BR.c55.s90">The alarm-bell rang--and it was pulled by no faint or hesitating hands--for a long time; but not a soul was seen.</s> <s sid="91" id="BR.c55.s91">Some of the insurgents said that when it ceased, they heard the shrieks of women, and saw some garments fluttering in the air, as a party of men bore away no unresisting burdens.</s> <s sid="92" id="BR.c55.s92">No one could say that this was true or false, in such an uproar; but where was Hugh?</s> <s sid="93" id="BR.c55.s93">Who among them had seen him, since the forcing of the doors?</s> <s sid="94" id="BR.c55.s94">The cry spread through the body.</s> <s sid="95" id="BR.c55.s95">Where was Hugh!</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="BR.c55.p32" type="speech"><s sid="96" id="BR.c55.s96"><qs/>'Here!'<qe/> he hoarsely cried, appearing from the darkness; out of breath, and blackened with the smoke.</s> <s sid="97" id="BR.c55.s97"><qs/>'We have done all we can; the fire is burning itself out; and even the corners where it hasn't spread, are nothing but heaps of ruins.</s> <s sid="98" id="BR.c55.s98">Disperse, my lads, while the coast's clear; get back by different ways; and meet as usual!'<qe/></s> <s sid="99" id="BR.c55.s99">With that, he disappeared again,--contrary to his wont, for he was always first to advance, and last to go away,--leaving them to follow homewards as they would.</s> </p><p pid="33" id="BR.c55.p33"><s sid="100" id="BR.c55.s100">It was not an easy task to draw off such a throng.</s> <s sid="101" id="BR.c55.s101">If Bedlam gates had been flung wide open, there would not have issued forth such maniacs as the frenzy of that night had made.</s> <s sid="102" id="BR.c55.s102">There were men there, who danced and trampled on the beds of flowers as though they trod down human enemies, and wrenched them from the stalks, like savages who twisted human necks.</s> <s sid="103" id="BR.c55.s103">There were men who cast their lighted torches in the air, and suffered them to fall upon their heads and faces, blistering the skin with deep unseemly burns.</s> <s sid="104" id="BR.c55.s104">There were men who rushed up to the fire, and paddled in it with their hands as if in water; and others who were restrained by force from plunging in, to gratify their deadly longing.</s> <s sid="105" id="BR.c55.s105">On the skull of one drunken lad--not twenty, by his looks--who lay upon the ground with a bottle to his mouth, the lead from the roof came streaming down in a shower of liquid fire, white hot; melting his head like wax.</s> <s sid="106" id="BR.c55.s106">When the scattered parties were collected, men-- living yet, but singed as with hot irons--were plucked out of the cellars, and carried off upon the shoulders of others, who strove to wake them as they went along, with ribald jokes, and left them, dead, in the passages of hospitals.</s> <s sid="107" id="BR.c55.s107">But of all the howling throng not one learnt mercy from, or sickened at, these sights; nor was the fierce, besotted, senseless rage of one man glutted.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="BR.c55.p34"><s sid="108" id="BR.c55.s108">Slowly, and in small clusters, with hoarse hurrahs and repetitions of their usual cry, the assembly dropped away.</s> <s sid="109" id="BR.c55.s109">The last few red- eyed stragglers reeled after those who had gone before; the distant noise of men calling to each other, and whistling for others whom they missed, grew fainter and fainter; at length even these sounds died away, and silence reigned alone.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="BR.c55.p35"><s sid="110" id="BR.c55.s110">Silence indeed!</s> <s sid="111" id="BR.c55.s111">The glare of the flames had sunk into a fitful, flashing light; and the gentle stars, invisible till now, looked down upon the blackening heap.</s> <s sid="112" id="BR.c55.s112">A dull smoke hung upon the ruin, as though to hide it from those eyes of Heaven; and the wind forbore to move it.</s> <s sid="113" id="BR.c55.s113">Bare walls, roof open to the sky--chambers, where the beloved dead had, many and many a fair day, risen to new life and energy; where so many dear ones had been sad and merry; which were connected with so many thoughts and hopes, regrets and changes--all gone.</s> <s sid="114" id="BR.c55.s114">Nothing left but a dull and dreary blank--a smouldering heap of dust and ashes--the silence and solitude of utter desolation.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="BR.c56.p1"><s sid="1" id="BR.c56.s1">The Maypole cronies, little drearning of the change so soon to come upon their favourite haunt, struck through the Forest path upon their way to London; and avoiding the main road, which was hot and dusty, kept to the by-paths and the fields.</s> <s sid="2" id="BR.c56.s2">As they drew nearer to their destination, they began to make inquiries of the people whom they passed, concerning the riots, and the truth or falsehood of the stories they had heard.</s> <s sid="3" id="BR.c56.s3">The answers went far beyond any intelligence that had spread to quiet Chigwell.</s> <s sid="4" id="BR.c56.s4">One man told them that that afternoon the Guards, conveying to Newgate some rioters who had been re-examined, had been set upon by the mob and compelled to retreat; another, that the houses of two witnesses near Clare Market were about to be pulled down when he came away; another, that Sir George Saville's house in Leicester Fields was to be burned that night, and that it would go hard with Sir George if he fell into the people's hands, as it was he who had brought in the Catholic bill.</s> <s sid="5" id="BR.c56.s5">All accounts agreed that the mob were out, in stronger numbers and more numerous parties than had yet appeared; that the streets were unsafe; that no man's house or life was worth an hour's purchase; that the public consternation was increasing every moment; and that many families had already fled the city.</s> <s sid="6" id="BR.c56.s6">One fellow who wore the popular colour, damned them for not having cockades in their hats, and bade them set a good watch to-morrow night upon their prison doors, for the locks would have a straining; another asked if they were fire-proof, that they walked abroad without the distinguishing mark of all good and true men;--and a third who rode on horseback, and was quite alone, ordered them to throw each man a shilling, in his hat, towards the support of the rioters.</s> <s sid="7" id="BR.c56.s7">Although they were afraid to refuse compliance with this demand, and were much alarmed by these reports, they agreed, having come so far, to go forward, and see the real state of things with their own eyes.</s> <s sid="8" id="BR.c56.s8">So they pushed on quicker, as men do who are excited by portentous news; and ruminating on what they had heard, spoke little to each other.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c56.p2" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="BR.c56.s9">It was now night, and as they came nearer to the city they had dismal confirmation of this intelligence in three great fires, all close together, which burnt fiercely and were gloomily reflected in the sky.</s> <s sid="10" id="BR.c56.s10">Arriving in the immediate suburbs, they found that almost every house had chalked upon its door in large characters <qs/>'No Popery,'<qe/> that the shops were shut, and that alarm and anxiety were depicted in every face they passed.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="BR.c56.p3"><s sid="11" id="BR.c56.s11">Noting these things with a degree of apprehension which neither of the three cared to impart, in its full extent, to his companions, they came to a turnpike-gate, which was shut.</s> <s sid="12" id="BR.c56.s12">They were passing through the turnstile on the path, when a horseman rode up from London at a hard gallop, and called to the toll-keeper in a voice of great agitation, to open quickly in the name of God.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BR.c56.p4" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="BR.c56.s13">The adjuration was so earnest and vehement, that the man, with a lantern in his hand, came running out--toll-keeper though he was-- and was about to throw the gate open, when happening to look behind him, he exclaimed, <qs/>'Good Heaven, what's that!</s> <s sid="14" id="BR.c56.s14">Another fire!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="BR.c56.p5"><s sid="15" id="BR.c56.s15">At this, the three turned their heads, and saw in the distance-- straight in the direction whence they had come--a broad sheet of flame, casting a threatening light upon the clouds, which glimmered as though the conflagration were behind them, and showed like a wrathful sunset.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="BR.c56.p17" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="BR.c56.s43">It was well the good horse knew the road he traversed, for never once--no, never once in all the journey--did Mr Haredale cast his eyes upon the ground, or turn them, for an instant, from the light towards which they sped so madly.</s> <s sid="44" id="BR.c56.s44">Once he said in a low voice, <qs/>'It is my house,'<qe/> but that was the only time he spoke.</s> <s sid="45" id="BR.c56.s45">When they came to dark and doubtful places, he never forgot to put his hand upon the little man to hold him more securely in his seat, but he kept his head erect and his eyes fixed on the fire, then, and always.</s> </p><p pid="18" id="BR.c56.p18"><s sid="46" id="BR.c56.s46">The road was dangerous enough, for they went the nearest way-- headlong--far from the highway--by lonely lanes and paths, where waggon-wheels had worn deep ruts; where hedge and ditch hemmed in the narrow strip of ground; and tall trees, arching overhead, made it profoundly dark.</s> <s sid="47" id="BR.c56.s47">But on, on, on, with neither stop nor stumble, till they reached the Maypole door, and could plainly see that the fire began to fade, as if for want of fuel.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="BR.c56.p21"><s sid="51" id="BR.c56.s51">He was a strong man, accustomed to restrain himself, and suppress his strong emotions; but this preparation for what was to follow-- though he had seen that fire burning, and knew that his house must be razed to the ground--was more than he could bear.</s> <s sid="52" id="BR.c56.s52">He covered his face with his hands for a moment, and turned away his head.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="BR.c56.p48"><s sid="115" id="BR.c56.s115">As they stood here, listening to the echoes as they died away, and hoping in vain to hear a voice they knew, some of the ashes in this turret slipped and rolled down.</s> <s sid="116" id="BR.c56.s116">Startled by the least noise in that melancholy place, Solomon looked up in his companion's face, and saw that he had turned towards the spot, and that he watched and listened keenly.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c61.p2"><s sid="4" id="BR.c61.s4">The people were all awake and up, for they were fearful of being burnt in their beds, and sought to comfort and assure each other by watching in company.</s> <s sid="5" id="BR.c61.s5">A few of the stoutest-hearted were armed and gathered in a body on the green.</s> <s sid="6" id="BR.c61.s6">To these, who knew him well, Mr Haredale addressed himself, briefly narrating what had happened, and beseeching them to aid in conveying the criminal to London before the dawn of day.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="BR.c66.p27"><s sid="76" id="BR.c66.s76">The scouts reported further, that this party meeting with some others who had been at similar work elsewhere, they all united into one, and drafting off a few men with the killed and wounded, marched away to Lord Mansfield's country seat at Caen Wood, between Hampstead and Highgate; bent upon destroying that house likewise, and lighting up a great fire there, which from that height should be seen all over London.</s> <s sid="77" id="BR.c66.s77">But in this, they were disappointed, for a party of horse having arrived before them, they retreated faster than they went, and came straight back to town.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="BR.c66.p28"><s sid="78" id="BR.c66.s78">There being now a great many parties in the streets, each went to work according to its humour, and a dozen houses were quickly blazing, including those of Sir John Fielding and two other justices, and four in Holborn--one of the greatest thoroughfares in London--which were all burning at the same time, and burned until they went out of themselves, for the people cut the engine hose, and would not suffer the firemen to play upon the flames.</s> <s sid="79" id="BR.c66.s79">At one house near Moorfields, they found in one of the rooms some canary birds in cages, and these they cast into the fire alive.</s> <s sid="80" id="BR.c66.s80">The poor little creatures screamed, it was said, like infants, when they were flung upon the blaze; and one man was so touched that he tried in vain to save them, which roused the indignation of the crowd, and nearly cost him his life.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="BR.c66.p29"><s sid="81" id="BR.c66.s81">At this same house, one of the fellows who went through the rooms, breaking the furniture and helping to destroy the building, found a child's doll--a poor toy--which he exhibited at the window to the mob below, as the image of some unholy saint which the late occupants had worshipped.</s> <s sid="82" id="BR.c66.s82">While he was doing this, another man with an equally tender conscience (they had both been foremost in throwing down the canary birds for roasting alive), took his seat on the parapet of the house, and harangued the crowd from a pamphlet circulated by the Association, relative to the true principles of Christianity!</s> <s sid="83" id="BR.c66.s83">Meanwhile the Lord Mayor, with his hands in his pockets, looked on as an idle man might look at any other show, and seemed mightily satisfied to have got a good place.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="BR.c66.p30"><s sid="84" id="BR.c66.s84">Such were the accounts brought to the old vintner by his servants as he sat at the side of Mr Haredale's bed, having been unable even to doze, after the first part of the night; too much disturbed by his own fears; by the cries of the mob, the light of the fires, and the firing of the soldiers.</s> <s sid="85" id="BR.c66.s85">Such, with the addition of the release of all the prisoners in the New Jail at Clerkenwell, and as many robberies of passengers in the streets, as the crowd had leisure to indulge in, were the scenes of which Mr Haredale was happily unconscious, and which were all enacted before midnight.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="3" id="BR.c67.p3"><s sid="7" id="BR.c67.s7">At the Lord President's in Piccadilly, at Lambeth Palace, at the Lord Chancellor's in Great Ormond Street, in the Royal Exchange, the Bank, the Guildhall, the Inns of Court, the Courts of Law, and every chamber fronting the streets near Westminster Hall and the Houses of Parliament, parties of soldiers were posted before daylight.</s> <s sid="8" id="BR.c67.s8">A body of Horse Guards paraded Palace Yard; an encampment was formed in the Park, where fifteen hundred men and five battalions of Militia were under arms; the Tower was fortified, the drawbridges were raised, the cannon loaded and pointed, and two regiments of artillery busied in strengthening the fortress and preparing it for defence.</s> <s sid="9" id="BR.c67.s9">A numerous detachment of soldiers were stationed to keep guard at the New River Head, which the people had threatened to attack, and where, it was said, they meant to cut off the main-pipes, so that there might be no water for the extinction of the flames.</s> <s sid="10" id="BR.c67.s10">In the Poultry, and on Cornhill, and at several other leading points, iron chains were drawn across the street; parties of soldiers were distributed in some of the old city churches while it was yet dark; and in several private houses (among them, Lord Rockingham's in Grosvenor Square); which were blockaded as though to sustain a siege, and had guns pointed from the windows.</s> <s sid="11" id="BR.c67.s11">When the sun rose, it shone into handsome apartments filled with armed men; the furniture hastily heaped away in corners, and made of little or no account, in the terror of the time--on arms glittering in city chambers, among desks and stools, and dusty books--into little smoky churchyards in odd lanes and by- ways, with soldiers lying down among the tombs, or lounging under the shade of the one old tree, and their pile of muskets sparkling in the light--on solitary sentries pacing up and down in courtyards, silent now, but yesterday resounding with the din and hum of business--everywhere on guard-rooms, garrisons, and threatening preparations.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BR.c67.p4"><s sid="12" id="BR.c67.s12">As the day crept on, still more unusual sights were witnessed in the streets.</s> <s sid="13" id="BR.c67.s13">The gates of the King's Bench and Fleet Prisons being opened at the usual hour, were found to have notices affixed to them, announcing that the rioters would come that night to burn them down.</s> <s sid="14" id="BR.c67.s14">The wardens, too well knowing the likelihood there was of this promise being fulfilled, were fain to set their prisoners at liberty, and give them leave to move their goods; so, all day, such of them as had any furniture were occupied in conveying it, some to this place, some to that, and not a few to the brokers' shops, where they gladly sold it, for any wretched price those gentry chose to give.</s> <s sid="15" id="BR.c67.s15">There were some broken men among these debtors who had been in jail so long, and were so miserable and destitute of friends, so dead to the world, and utterly forgotten and uncared for, that they implored their jailers not to set them free, and to send them, if need were, to some other place of custody.</s> <s sid="16" id="BR.c67.s16">But they, refusing to comply, lest they should incur the anger of the mob, turned them into the streets, where they wandered up and down hardly remembering the ways untrodden by their feet so long, and crying--such abject things those rotten-hearted jails had made them--as they slunk off in their rags, and dragged their slipshod feet along the pavement.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BR.c67.p5"><s sid="17" id="BR.c67.s17">Even of the three hundred prisoners who had escaped from Newgate, there were some--a few, but there were some--who sought their jailers out and delivered themselves up: preferring imprisonment and punishment to the horrors of such another night as the last.</s> <s sid="18" id="BR.c67.s18">Many of the convicts, drawn back to their old place of captivity by some indescribable attraction, or by a desire to exult over it in its downfall and glut their revenge by seeing it in ashes, actually went back in broad noon, and loitered about the cells.</s> <s sid="19" id="BR.c67.s19">Fifty were retaken at one time on this next day, within the prison walls; but their fate did not deter others, for there they went in spite of everything, and there they were taken in twos and threes, twice or thrice a day, all through the week.</s> <s sid="20" id="BR.c67.s20">Of the fifty just mentioned, some were occupied in endeavouring to rekindle the fire; but in general they seemed to have no object in view but to prowl and lounge about the old place: being often found asleep in the ruins, or sitting talking there, or even eating and drinking, as in a choice retreat.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="BR.c67.p6"><s sid="21" id="BR.c67.s21">Besides the notices on the gates of the Fleet and the King's Bench, many similar announcements were left, before one o'clock at noon, at the houses of private individuals; and further, the mob proclaimed their intention of seizing on the Bank, the Mint, the Arsenal at Woolwich, and the Royal Palaces.</s> <s sid="22" id="BR.c67.s22">The notices were seldom delivered by more than one man, who, if it were at a shop, went in, and laid it, with a bloody threat perhaps, upon the counter; or if it were at a private house, knocked at the door, and thrust it in the servant's hand.</s> <s sid="23" id="BR.c67.s23">Notwithstanding the presence of the military in every quarter of the town, and the great force in the Park, these messengers did their errands with impunity all through the day.</s> <s sid="24" id="BR.c67.s24">So did two boys who went down Holborn alone, armed with bars taken from the railings of Lord Mansfield's house, and demanded money for the rioters.</s> <s sid="25" id="BR.c67.s25">So did a tall man on horseback who made a collection for the same purpose in Fleet Street, and refused to take anything but gold.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="BR.c67.p7"><s sid="26" id="BR.c67.s26">A rumour had now got into circulation, too, which diffused a greater dread all through London, even than these publicly announced intentions of the rioters, though all men knew that if they were successfully effected, there must ensue a national bankruptcy and general ruin.</s> <s sid="27" id="BR.c67.s27">It was said that they meant to throw the gates of Bedlam open, and let all the madmen loose.</s> <s sid="28" id="BR.c67.s28">This suggested such dreadful images to the people's minds, and was indeed an act so fraught with new and unimaginable horrors in the contemplation, that it beset them more than any loss or cruelty of which they could foresee the worst, and drove many sane men nearly mad themselves.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="BR.c67.p8"><s sid="29" id="BR.c67.s29">So the day passed on: the prisoners moving their goods; people running to and fro in the streets, carrying away their property; groups standing in silence round the ruins; all business suspended; and the soldiers disposed as has been already mentioned, remaining quite inactive.</s> <s sid="30" id="BR.c67.s30">So the day passed on, and dreaded night drew near again.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="BR.c67.p9"><s sid="31" id="BR.c67.s31">At last, at seven o'clock in the evening, the Privy Council issued a solemn proclamation that it was now necessary to employ the military, and that the officers had most direct and effectual orders, by an immediate exertion of their utmost force, to repress the disturbances; and warning all good subjects of the King to keep themselves, their servants, and apprentices, within doors that night.</s> <s sid="32" id="BR.c67.s32">There was then delivered out to every soldier on duty, thirty-six rounds of powder and ball; the drums beat; and the whole force was under arms at sunset.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="BR.c67.p11"><s sid="41" id="BR.c67.s41">But in this reckoning they were cruelly mistaken, for in half an hour, or less, as though the setting in of night had been their preconcerted signal, the rioters having previously, in small parties, prevented the lighting of the street lamps, rose like a great sea; and that in so many places at once, and with such inconceivable fury, that those who had the direction of the troops knew not, at first, where to turn or what to do.</s> <s sid="42" id="BR.c67.s42">One after another, new fires blazed up in every quarter of the town, as though it were the intention of the insurgents to wrap the city in a circle of flames, which, contracting by degrees, should burn the whole to ashes; the crowd swarmed and roared in every street; and none but rioters and soldiers being out of doors, it seemed to the latter as if all London were arrayed against them, and they stood alone against the town.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c70.p2"><s sid="3" id="BR.c70.s3">As he walked along the streets with his leather gloves clasped behind him, and his face indicative of cheerful thought and pleasant calculation, Mr Dennis might have been likened unto a farmer ruminating among his crops, and enjoying by anticipation the bountiful gifts of Providence.</s> <s sid="4" id="BR.c70.s4">Look where he would, some heap of ruins afforded him rich promise of a working off; the whole town appeared to have been ploughed and sown, and nurtured by most genial weather; and a goodly harvest was at hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BR.c70.p3"><s sid="5" id="BR.c70.s5">Having taken up arms and resorted to deeds of violence, with the great main object of preserving the Old Bailey in all its purity, and the gallows in all its pristine usefulness and moral grandeur, it would perhaps be going too far to assert that Mr Dennis had ever distinctly contemplated and foreseen this happy state of things.</s> <s sid="6" id="BR.c70.s6">He rather looked upon it as one of those beautiful dispensations which are inscrutably brought about for the behoof and advantage of good men.</s> <s sid="7" id="BR.c70.s7">He felt, as it were, personally referred to, in this prosperous ripening for the gibbet; and had never considered himself so much the pet and favourite child of Destiny, or loved that lady so well or with such a calm and virtuous reliance, in all his life.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c71.p2"><s sid="6" id="BR.c71.s6">Whether this change was occasioned by the presence among them of some person of authority in their ranks, or by any other cause, they were unable to decide.</s> <s sid="7" id="BR.c71.s7">Sometimes they thought it was in part attributable to there being a sick man in the chamber, for last night there had been a shuffling of feet, as though a burden were brought in, and afterwards a moaning noise.</s> <s sid="8" id="BR.c71.s8">But they had no means of ascertaining the truth: for any question or entreaty on their parts only provoked a storm of execrations, or something worse; and they were too happy to be left alone, unassailed by threats or admiration, to risk even that comfort, by any voluntary communication with those who held them in durance.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BR.c71.p3"><s sid="9" id="BR.c71.s9">It was sufficiently evident, both to Emma and to the locksmith's poor little daughter herself, that she, Dolly, was the great object of attraction; and that so soon as they should have leisure to indulge in the softer passion, Hugh and Mr Tappertit would certainly fall to blows for her sake; in which latter case, it was not very difficult to see whose prize she would become.</s> <s sid="10" id="BR.c71.s10">With all her old horror of that man revived, and deepened into a degree of aversion and abhorrence which no language can describe; with a thousand old recollections and regrets, and causes of distress, anxiety, and fear, besetting her on all sides; poor Dolly Varden-- sweet, blooming, buxom Dolly--began to hang her head, and fade, and droop, like a beautiful flower.</s> <s sid="11" id="BR.c71.s11">The colour fled from her cheeks, her courage forsook her, her gentle heart failed.</s> <s sid="12" id="BR.c71.s12">Unmindful of all her provoking caprices, forgetful of all her conquests and inconstancy, with all her winning little vanities quite gone, she nestled all the livelong day in Emma Haredale's bosom; and, sometimes calling on her dear old grey-haired father, sometimes on her mother, and sometimes even on her old home, pined slowly away, like a poor bird in its cage.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BR.c71.p4"><s sid="13" id="BR.c71.s13">Light hearts, light hearts, that float so gaily on a smooth stream, that are so sparkling and buoyant in the sunshine--down upon fruit, bloom upon flowers, blush in summer air, life of the winged insect, whose whole existence is a day--how soon ye sink in troubled water!</s> <s sid="14" id="BR.c71.s14">Poor Dolly's heart--a little, gentle, idle, fickle thing; giddy, restless, fluttering; constant to nothing but bright looks, and smiles and laughter--Dolly's heart was breaking.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="BR.c71.p5"><s sid="15" id="BR.c71.s15">Emma had known grief, and could bear it better.</s> <s sid="16" id="BR.c71.s16">She had little comfort to impart, but she could soothe and tend her, and she did so; and Dolly clung to her like a child to its nurse.</s> <s sid="17" id="BR.c71.s17">In endeavouring to inspire her with some fortitude, she increased her own; and though the nights were long, and the days dismal, and she felt the wasting influence of watching and fatigue, and had perhaps a more defined and clear perception of their destitute condition and its worst dangers, she uttered no complaint.</s> <s sid="18" id="BR.c71.s18">Before the ruffians, in whose power they were, she bore herself so calmly, and with such an appearance, in the midst of all her terror, of a secret conviction that they dared not harm her, that there was not a man among them but held her in some degree of dread; and more than one believed she had a weapon hidden in her dress, and was prepared to use it.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="BR.c71.p6"><s sid="19" id="BR.c71.s19">Such was their condition when they were joined by Miss Miggs, who gave them to understand that she too had been taken prisoner because of her charms, and detailed such feats of resistance she had performed (her virtue having given her supernatural strength), that they felt it quite a happiness to have her for a champion.</s> <s sid="20" id="BR.c71.s20">Nor was this the only comfort they derived at first from Miggs's presence and society: for that young lady displayed such resignation and long-suffering, and so much meek endurance, under her trials, and breathed in all her chaste discourse a spirit of such holy confidence and resignation, and devout belief that all would happen for the best, that Emma felt her courage strengthened by the bright example; never doubting but that everything she said was true, and that she, like them, was torn from all she loved, and agonised by doubt and apprehension.</s> <s sid="21" id="BR.c71.s21">As to poor Dolly, she was roused, at first, by seeing one who came from home; but when she heard under what circumstances she had left it, and into whose hands her father had fallen, she wept more bitterly than ever, and refused all comfort.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="BR.c71.p7"><s sid="22" id="BR.c71.s22">Miss Miggs was at some trouble to reprove her for this state of mind, and to entreat her to take example by herself, who, she said, was now receiving back, with interest, tenfold the amount of her subscriptions to the red-brick dwelling-house, in the articles of peace of mind and a quiet conscience.</s> <s sid="23" id="BR.c71.s23">And, while on serious topics, Miss Miggs considered it her duty to try her hand at the conversion of Miss Haredale; for whose improvement she launched into a polemical address of some length, in the course whereof, she likened herself unto a chosen missionary, and that young lady to a cannibal in darkness.</s> <s sid="24" id="BR.c71.s24">Indeed, she returned so often to these sublects, and so frequently called upon them to take a lesson from her,--at the same time vaunting and, as it were, rioting in, her huge unworthiness, and abundant excess of sin,--that, in the course of a short time, she became, in that small chamber, rather a nuisance than a comfort, and rendered them, if possible, even more unhappy than they had been before.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="BR.c71.p8"><s sid="25" id="BR.c71.s25">The night had now come; and for the first time (for their jailers had been regular in bringing food and candles), they were left in darkness.</s> <s sid="26" id="BR.c71.s26">Any change in their condition in such a place inspired new fears; and when some hours had passed, and the gloom was still unbroken, Emma could no longer repress her alarm.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="BR.c71.p9"><s sid="27" id="BR.c71.s27">They listened attentively.</s> <s sid="28" id="BR.c71.s28">There was the same murmuring in the outer room, and now and then a moan which seemed to be wrung from a person in great pain, who made an effort to subdue it, but could not.</s> <s sid="29" id="BR.c71.s29">Even these men seemed to be in darkness too; for no light shone through the chinks in the door, nor were they moving, as their custom was, but quite still: the silence being unbroken by so much as the creaking of a board.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="BR.c71.p10" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="BR.c71.s30">At first, Miss Miggs wondered greatly in her own mind who this sick person might be; but arriving, on second thoughts, at the conclusion that he was a part of the schemes on foot, and an artful device soon to be employed with great success, she opined, for Miss Haredale's comfort, that it must be some misguided Papist who had been wounded: and this happy supposition encouraged her to say, under her breath, <qs/>'Ally Looyer!'<qe/> several times.</s> </p><p pid="11" id="BR.c71.p11" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="BR.c71.s31"><qs/>'Is it possible,'<qe/><sls/> said Emma, with some indignation, <sle/><qs/>'that you who have seen these men committing the outrages you have told us of, and who have fallen into their hands, like us, can exult in their cruelties!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="12" id="BR.c71.p12" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="BR.c71.s32"><qs/>'Personal considerations, miss,'<qe/><sss/> rejoined Miggs, <sse/><qs/>'sinks into nothing, afore a noble cause.</s> <s sid="33" id="BR.c71.s33">Ally Looyer!</s> <s sid="34" id="BR.c71.s34">Ally Looyer!</s> <s sid="35" id="BR.c71.s35">Ally Looyer, good gentlemen!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="BR.c71.p13"><s sid="36" id="BR.c71.s36">It seemed from the shrill pertinacity with which Miss Miggs repeated this form of acclamation, that she was calling the same through the keyhole of the door; but in the profound darkness she could not be seen.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="BR.c71.p14" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="BR.c71.s37"><qs/>'If the time has come--Heaven knows it may come at any moment--when they are bent on prosecuting the designs, whatever they may be, with which they have brought us here, can you still encourage, and take part with them?'<qe/> demanded Emma.</s> </p><p pid="15" id="BR.c71.p15" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="BR.c71.s38"><qs/>'I thank my goodness-gracious-blessed-stars I can, miss,'<qe/><sls/> returned Miggs, with increased energy.--<sle/><qs/>'Ally Looyer, good gentlemen!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="16" id="BR.c71.p16"><s sid="39" id="BR.c71.s39">Even Dolly, cast down and disappointed as she was, revived at this, and bade Miggs hold her tongue directly.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="BR.c71.p17" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="BR.c71.s40"><qs/>'WHICH, was you pleased to observe, Miss Varden?'<qe/> said Miggs, with a strong emphasis on the irrelative pronoun.</s> </p><p pid="18" id="BR.c71.p18"><s sid="41" id="BR.c71.s41">Dolly repeated her request.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="BR.c71.p19" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="BR.c71.s42"><qs/>'Ho, gracious me!'<qe/> cried Miggs, with hysterical derision.</s> <s sid="43" id="BR.c71.s43"><qs/>'Ho, gracious me!</s> <s sid="44" id="BR.c71.s44">Yes, to be sure I will.</s> <s sid="45" id="BR.c71.s45">Ho yes!</s> <s sid="46" id="BR.c71.s46">I am a abject slave, and a toiling, moiling, constant-working, always-being- found-fault-with, never-giving-satisfactions, nor-having-no- time-to-clean-oneself, potter's wessel--an't I, miss!</s> <s sid="47" id="BR.c71.s47">Ho yes!</s> <s sid="48" id="BR.c71.s48">My situations is lowly, and my capacities is limited, and my duties is to humble myself afore the base degenerating daughters of their blessed mothers as is--fit to keep companies with holy saints but is born to persecutions from wicked relations--and to demean myself before them as is no better than Infidels--an't it, miss!</s> <s sid="49" id="BR.c71.s49">Ho yes!</s> <s sid="50" id="BR.c71.s50">My only becoming occupations is to help young flaunting pagins to brush and comb and titiwate theirselves into whitening and suppulchres, and leave the young men to think that there an't a bit of padding in it nor no pinching ins nor fillings out nor pomatums nor deceits nor earthly wanities--an't it, miss!</s> <s sid="51" id="BR.c71.s51">Yes, to be sure it is--ho yes!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="20" id="BR.c71.p20"><s sid="52" id="BR.c71.s52">Having delivered these ironical passages with a most wonderful volubility, and with a shrillness perfectly deafening (especially when she jerked out the interjections), Miss Miggs, from mere habit, and not because weeping was at all appropriate to the occasion, which was one of triumph, concluded by bursting into a flood of tears, and calling in an impassioned manner on the name of Simmuns.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="BR.c71.p21"><s sid="53" id="BR.c71.s53">What Emma Haredale and Dolly would have done, or how long Miss Miggs, now that she had hoisted her true colours, would have gone on waving them before their astonished senses, it is impossible to tell.</s> <s sid="54" id="BR.c71.s54">Nor is it necessary to speculate on these matters, for a startling interruption occurred at that moment, which took their whole attention by storm.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="BR.c71.p22"><s sid="55" id="BR.c71.s55">This was a violent knocking at the door of the house, and then its sudden bursting open; which was immediately succeeded by a scuffle in the room without, and the clash of weapons.</s> <s sid="56" id="BR.c71.s56">Transported with the hope that rescue had at length arrived, Emma and Dolly shrieked aloud for help; nor were their shrieks unanswered; for after a hurried interval, a man, bearing in one hand a drawn sword, and in the other a taper, rushed into the chamber where they were confined.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="BR.c71.p23"><s sid="57" id="BR.c71.s57">It was some check upon their transport to find in this person an entire stranger, but they appealed to him, nevertheless, and besought him, in impassioned language, to restore them to their friends.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="BR.c73.p1"><s sid="1" id="BR.c73.s1">By this Friday night--for it was on Friday in the riot week, that Emma and Dolly were rescued, by the timely aid of Joe and Edward Chester--the disturbances were entirely quelled, and peace and order were restored to the affrighted city.</s> <s sid="2" id="BR.c73.s2">True, after what had happened, it was impossible for any man to say how long this better state of things might last, or how suddenly new outrages, exceeding even those so lately witnessed, might burst forth and fill its streets with ruin and bloodshed; for this reason, those who had fled from the recent tumults still kept at a distance, and many families, hitherto unable to procure the means of flight, now availed themselves of the calm, and withdrew into the country.</s> <s sid="3" id="BR.c73.s3">The shops, too, from Tyburn to Whitechapel, were still shut; and very little business was transacted in any of the places of great commercial resort.</s> <s sid="4" id="BR.c73.s4">But, notwithstanding, and in spite of the melancholy forebodings of that numerous class of society who see with the greatest clearness into the darkest perspectives, the town remained profoundly quiet.</s> <s sid="5" id="BR.c73.s5">The strong military force disposed in every advantageous quarter, and stationed at every commanding point, held the scattered fragments of the mob in check; the search after rioters was prosecuted with unrelenting vigour; and if there were any among them so desperate and reckless as to be inclined, after the terrible scenes they had beheld, to venture forth again, they were so daunted by these resolute measures, that they quickly shrunk into their hiding-places, and had no thought but for their safety.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c73.p2"><s sid="6" id="BR.c73.s6">In a word, the crowd was utterly routed.</s> <s sid="7" id="BR.c73.s7">Upwards of two hundred had been shot dead in the streets.</s> <s sid="8" id="BR.c73.s8">Two hundred and fifty more were lying, badly wounded, in the hospitals; of whom seventy or eighty died within a short time afterwards.</s> <s sid="9" id="BR.c73.s9">A hundred were already in custody, and more were taken every hour.</s> <s sid="10" id="BR.c73.s10">How many perished in the conflagrations, or by their own excesses, is unknown; but that numbers found a terrible grave in the hot ashes of the flames they had kindled, or crept into vaults and cellars to drink in secret or to nurse their sores, and never saw the light again, is certain.</s> <s sid="11" id="BR.c73.s11">When the embers of the fires had been black and cold for many weeks, the labourers' spades proved this, beyond a doubt.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BR.c73.p3"><s sid="12" id="BR.c73.s12">Seventy-two private houses and four strong jails were destroyed in the four great days of these riots.</s> <s sid="13" id="BR.c73.s13">The total loss of property, as estimated by the sufferers, was one hundred and fifty-five thousand pounds; at the lowest and least partial estimate of disinterested persons, it exceeded one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds.</s> <s sid="14" id="BR.c73.s14">For this immense loss, compensation was soon afterwards made out of the public purse, in pursuance of a vote of the House of Commons; the sum being levied on the various wards in the city, on the county, and the borough of Southwark.</s> <s sid="15" id="BR.c73.s15">Both Lord Mansfield and Lord Saville, however, who had been great sufferers, refused to accept of any compensation whatever.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BR.c73.p4" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="BR.c73.s16">The House of Commons, sitting on Tuesday with locked and guarded doors, had passed a resolution to the effect that, as soon as the tumults subsided, it would immediately proceed to consider the petitions presented from many of his Majesty's Protestant subjects, and would take the same into its serious consideration.</s> <s sid="17" id="BR.c73.s17">While this question was under debate, Mr Herbert, one of the members present, indignantly rose and called upon the House to observe that Lord George Gordon was then sitting under the gallery with the blue cockade, the signal of rebellion, in his hat.</s> <s sid="18" id="BR.c73.s18">He was not only obliged, by those who sat near, to take it out; but offering to go into the street to pacify the mob with the somewhat indefinite assurance that the House was prepared to give them <qs/>'the satisfaction they sought,'<qe/> was actually held down in his seat by the combined force of several members.</s> <s sid="19" id="BR.c73.s19">In short, the disorder and violence which reigned triumphant out of doors, penetrated into the senate, and there, as elsewhere, terror and alarm prevailed, and ordinary forms were for the time forgotten.</s> </p><p pid="5" id="BR.c73.p5"><s sid="20" id="BR.c73.s20">On the Thursday, both Houses had adjourned until the following Monday se'nnight, declaring it impossible to pursue their deliberations with the necessary gravity and freedom, while they were surrounded by armed troops.</s> <s sid="21" id="BR.c73.s21">And now that the rioters were dispersed, the citizens were beset with a new fear; for, finding the public thoroughfares and all their usual places of resort filled with soldiers entrusted with the free use of fire and sword, they began to lend a greedy ear to the rumours which were afloat of martial law being declared, and to dismal stories of prisoners having been seen hanging on lamp-posts in Cheapside and Fleet Street.</s> <s sid="22" id="BR.c73.s22">These terrors being promptly dispelled by a Proclamation declaring that all the rioters in custody would be tried by a special commission in due course of law, a fresh alarm was engendered by its being whispered abroad that French money had been found on some of the rioters, and that the disturbances had been fomented by foreign powers who sought to compass the overthrow and ruin of England.</s> <s sid="23" id="BR.c73.s23">This report, which was strengthened by the diffusion of anonymous handbills, but which, if it had any foundation at all, probably owed its origin to the circumstance of some few coins which were not English money having been swept into the pockets of the insurgents with other miscellaneous booty, and afterwards discovered on the prisoners or the dead bodies,--caused a great sensation; and men's minds being in that excited state when they are most apt to catch at any shadow of apprehension, was bruited about with much industry.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="BR.c77.p2"><s sid="4" id="BR.c77.s4">Into the street outside the jail's main wall, workmen came straggling at this solemn hour, in groups of two or three, and meeting in the centre, cast their tools upon the ground and spoke in whispers.</s> <s sid="5" id="BR.c77.s5">Others soon issued from the jail itself, bearing on their shoulders planks and beams: these materials being all brought forth, the rest bestirred themselves, and the dull sound of hammers began to echo through the stillness.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="BR.c77.p3"><s sid="6" id="BR.c77.s6">Here and there among this knot of labourers, one, with a lantern or a smoky link, stood by to light his fellows at their work; and by its doubtful aid, some might be dimly seen taking up the pavement of the road, while others held great upright posts, or fixed them in the holes thus made for their reception.</s> <s sid="7" id="BR.c77.s7">Some dragged slowly on, towards the rest, an empty cart, which they brought rumbling from the prison-yard; while others erected strong barriers across the street.</s> <s sid="8" id="BR.c77.s8">All were busily engaged.</s> <s sid="9" id="BR.c77.s9">Their dusky figures moving to and fro, at that unusual hour, so active and so silent, might have been taken for those of shadowy creatures toiling at midnight on some ghostly unsubstantial work, which, like themselves, would vanish with the first gleam of day, and leave but morning mist and vapour.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="BR.c77.p4"><s sid="10" id="BR.c77.s10">While it was yet dark, a few lookers-on collected, who had plainly come there for the purpose and intended to remain: even those who had to pass the spot on their way to some other place, lingered, and lingered yet, as though the attraction of that were irresistible.</s> <s sid="11" id="BR.c77.s11">Meanwhile the noise of saw and mallet went on briskly, mingled with the clattering of boards on the stone pavement of the road, and sometimes with the workmen's voices as they called to one another.</s> <s sid="12" id="BR.c77.s12">Whenever the chimes of the neighbouring church were heard--and that was every quarter of an hour--a strange sensation, instantaneous and indescribable, but perfectly obvious, seemed to pervade them all.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="BR.c77.p7"><s sid="20" id="BR.c77.s20">As the warmth of the cheerful day began to shed itself upon the scanty crowd, the murmur of tongues was heard, shutters were thrown open, and blinds drawn up, and those who had slept in rooms over against the prison, where places to see the execution were let at high prices, rose hastily from their beds.</s> <s sid="21" id="BR.c77.s21">In some of the houses, people were busy taking out the window-sashes for the better accommodation of spectators; in others, the spectators were already seated, and beguiling the time with cards, or drink, or jokes among themselves.</s> <s sid="22" id="BR.c77.s22">Some had purchased seats upon the house-tops, and were already crawling to their stations from parapet and garret- window.</s> <s sid="23" id="BR.c77.s23">Some were yet bargaining for good places, and stood in them in a state of indecision: gazing at the slowly-swelling crowd, and at the workmen as they rested listlessly against the scaffold-- affecting to listen with indifference to the proprietor's eulogy of the commanding view his house afforded, and the surpassing cheapness of his terms.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="BR.c77.p10"><s sid="31" id="BR.c77.s31">Five o'clock had struck--six--seven--and eight.</s> <s sid="32" id="BR.c77.s32">Along the two main streets at either end of the cross-way, a living stream had now set in, rolling towards the marts of gain and business.</s> <s sid="33" id="BR.c77.s33">Carts, coaches, waggons, trucks, and barrows, forced a passage through the outskirts of the throng, and clattered onward in the same direction.</s> <s sid="34" id="BR.c77.s34">Some of these which were public conveyances and had come from a short distance in the country, stopped; and the driver pointed to the gibbet with his whip, though he might have spared himself the pains, for the heads of all the passengers were turned that way without his help, and the coach-windows were stuck full of staring eyes.</s> <s sid="35" id="BR.c77.s35">In some of the carts and waggons, women might be seen, glancing fearfully at the same unsightly thing; and even little children were held up above the people's heads to see what kind of a toy a gallows was, and learn how men were hanged.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="BR.c77.p11"><s sid="36" id="BR.c77.s36">Two rioters were to die before the prison, who had been concerned in the attack upon it; and one directly afterwards in Bloomsbury Square.</s> <s sid="37" id="BR.c77.s37">At nine o'clock, a strong body of military marched into the street, and formed and lined a narrow passage into Holborn, which had been indifferently kept all night by constables.</s> <s sid="38" id="BR.c77.s38">Through this, another cart was brought (the one already mentioned had been employed in the construction of the scaffold), and wheeled up to the prison-gate.</s> <s sid="39" id="BR.c77.s39">These preparations made, the soldiers stood at ease; the officers lounged to and fro, in the alley they had made, or talked together at the scaffold's foot; and the concourse, which had been rapidly augmenting for some hours, and still received additions every minute, waited with an impatience which increased with every chime of St Sepulchre's clock, for twelve at noon.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="BR.c77.p12"><s sid="40" id="BR.c77.s40">Up to this time they had been very quiet, comparatively silent, save when the arrival of some new party at a window, hitherto unoccupied, gave them something new to look at or to talk of.</s> <s sid="41" id="BR.c77.s41">But, as the hour approached, a buzz and hum arose, which, deepening every moment, soon swelled into a roar, and seemed to fill the air.</s> <s sid="42" id="BR.c77.s42">No words or even voices could be distinguished in this clamour, nor did they speak much to each other; though such as were better informed upon the topic than the rest, would tell their neighbours, perhaps, that they might know the hangman when he came out, by his being the shorter one: and that the man who was to suffer with him was named Hugh: and that it was Barnaby Rudge who would be hanged in Bloomsbury Square.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="BR.c77.p13"><s sid="43" id="BR.c77.s43">The hum grew, as the time drew near, so loud, that those who were at the windows could not hear the church-clock strike, though it was close at hand.</s> <s sid="44" id="BR.c77.s44">Nor had they any need to hear it, either, for they could see it in the people's faces.</s> <s sid="45" id="BR.c77.s45">So surely as another quarter chimed, there was a movement in the crowd--as if something had passed over it--as if the light upon them had been changed--in which the fact was readable as on a brazen dial, figured by a giant's hand.</s> </p>
