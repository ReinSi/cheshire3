<stru>PREFACE TO 1850 EDITION





I do not find it easy to get sufficiently far away from this Book,

in the first sensations of having finished it, to refer to it with

the composure which this formal heading would seem to require.  My

interest in it, is so recent and strong; and my mind is so divided

between pleasure and regret - pleasure in the achievement of a long

design, regret in the separation from many companions - that I am

in danger of wearying the reader whom I love, with personal

confidences, and private emotions.



Besides which, all that I could say of the Story, to any purpose,

I have endeavoured to say in it.



It would concern the reader little, perhaps, to know, how

sorrowfully the pen is laid down at the close of a two-years'

imaginative task; or how an Author feels as if he were dismissing

some portion of himself into the shadowy world, when a crowd of the

creatures of his brain are going from him for ever.  Yet, I have

nothing else to tell; unless, indeed, I were to confess (which

might be of less moment still) that no one can ever believe this

Narrative, in the reading, more than I have believed it in the

writing.



Instead of looking back, therefore, I will look forward.  I cannot

close this Volume more agreeably to myself, than with a hopeful

glance towards the time when I shall again put forth my two green

leaves once a month, and with a faithful remembrance of the genial

sun and showers that have fallen on these leaves of David

Copperfield, and made me happy.

     London, October, 1850.





PREFACE TO

THE CHARLES DICKENS EDITION





I REMARKED in the original Preface to this Book, that I did not

find it easy to get sufficiently far away from it, in the first

sensations of having finished it, to refer to it with the composure

which this formal heading would seem to require.  My interest in it

was so recent and strong, and my mind was so divided between

pleasure and regret - pleasure in the achievement of a long design,

regret in the separation from many companions - that I was in

danger of wearying the reader with personal confidences and private

emotions.



Besides which, all that I could have said of the Story to any

purpose, I had endeavoured to say in it.



It would concern the reader little, perhaps, to know how

sorrowfully the pen is laid down at the close of a two-years'

imaginative task; or how an Author feels as if he were dismissing

some portion of himself into the shadowy world, when a crowd of the

creatures of his brain are going from him for ever.  Yet, I had

nothing else to tell; unless, indeed, I were to confess (which

might be of less moment still), that no one can ever believe this

Narrative, in the reading, more than I believed it in the writing.



So true are these avowals at the present day, that I can now only

take the reader into one confidence more.  Of all my books, I like

this the best.  It will be easily believed that I am a fond parent

to every child of my fancy, and that no one can ever love that

family as dearly as I love them.  But, like many fond parents, I

have in my heart of hearts a favourite child.  And his name is

DAVID COPPERFIELD.

<title>CHAPTER 1 I AM BORN</title>

<p pid="1" id="DC.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="DC.c1.s1">Whether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.</s> <s sid="2" id="DC.c1.s2">To begin my life with the beginning of my life, I record that I was born (as I have been informed and believe) on a Friday, at twelve o'clock at night.</s> <s sid="3" id="DC.c1.s3">It was remarked that the clock began to strike, and I began to cry, simultaneously.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c1.p2"><s sid="4" id="DC.c1.s4">In consideration of the day and hour of my birth, it was declared by the nurse, and by some sage women in the neighbourhood who had taken a lively interest in me several months before there was any possibility of our becoming personally acquainted, first, that I was destined to be unlucky in life; and secondly, that I was privileged to see ghosts and spirits; both these gifts inevitably attaching, as they believed, to all unlucky infants of either gender, born towards the small hours on a Friday night.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DC.c1.p3"><s sid="5" id="DC.c1.s5">I need say nothing here, on the first head, because nothing can show better than my history whether that prediction was verified or falsified by the result.</s> <s sid="6" id="DC.c1.s6">On the second branch of the question, I will only remark, that unless I ran through that part of my inheritance while I was still a baby, I have not come into it yet.</s> <s sid="7" id="DC.c1.s7">But I do not at all complain of having been kept out of this property; and if anybody else should be in the present enjoyment of it, he is heartily welcome to keep it.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DC.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="DC.c1.s8">I was born with a caul, which was advertised for sale, in the newspapers, at the low price of fifteen guineas.</s> <s sid="9" id="DC.c1.s9">Whether sea-going people were short of money about that time, or were short of faith and preferred cork jackets, I don't know; all I know is, that there was but one solitary bidding, and that was from an attorney connected with the bill-broking business, who offered two pounds in cash, and the balance in sherry, but declined to be guaranteed from drowning on any higher bargain.</s> <s sid="10" id="DC.c1.s10">Consequently the advertisement was withdrawn at a dead loss - for as to sherry, my poor dear mother's own sherry was in the market then - and ten years afterwards, the caul was put up in a raffle down in our part of the country, to fifty members at half-a-crown a head, the winner to spend five shillings.</s> <s sid="11" id="DC.c1.s11">I was present myself, and I remember to have felt quite uncomfortable and confused, at a part of myself being disposed of in that way.</s> <s sid="12" id="DC.c1.s12">The caul was won, I recollect, by an old lady with a hand-basket, who, very reluctantly, produced from it the stipulated five shillings, all in halfpence, and twopence halfpenny short - as it took an immense time and a great waste of arithmetic, to endeavour without any effect to prove to her.</s> <s sid="13" id="DC.c1.s13">It is a fact which will be long remembered as remarkable down there, that she was never drowned, but died triumphantly in bed, at ninety-two.</s> <s sid="14" id="DC.c1.s14">I have understood that it was, to the last, her proudest boast, that she never had been on the water in her life, except upon a bridge; and that over her tea (to which she was extremely partial) she, to the last, expressed her indignation at the impiety of mariners and others, who had the presumption to go <qs/>'meandering' about the world.</s> <s sid="15" id="DC.c1.s15">It was in vain to represent to her that some conveniences, tea perhaps included, resulted from this objectionable practice.</s> <s sid="16" id="DC.c1.s16">She always returned, with greater emphasis and with an instinctive knowledge of the strength of her objection, 'Let us have no meandering.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="DC.c1.p5"><s sid="17" id="DC.c1.s17">Not to meander myself, at present, I will go back to my birth.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DC.c1.p6"><s sid="18" id="DC.c1.s18">I was born at Blunderstone, in Suffolk, or 'there by', as they say in Scotland.</s> <s sid="19" id="DC.c1.s19">I was a posthumous child.</s> <s sid="20" id="DC.c1.s20">My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it.</s> <s sid="21" id="DC.c1.s21">There is something strange to me, even now, in the reflection that he never saw me; and something stranger yet in the shadowy remembrance that I have of my first childish associations with his white grave-stone in the churchyard, and of the indefinable compassion I used to feel for it lying out alone there in the dark night, when our little parlour was warm and bright with fire and candle, and the doors of our house were - almost cruelly, it seemed to me sometimes - bolted and locked against it.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DC.c1.p7"><s sid="22" id="DC.c1.s22">An aunt of my father's, and consequently a great-aunt of mine, of whom I shall have more to relate by and by, was the principal magnate of our family.</s> <s sid="23" id="DC.c1.s23">Miss Trotwood, or Miss Betsey, as my poor mother always called her, when she sufficiently overcame her dread of this formidable personage to mention her at all (which was seldom), had been married to a husband younger than herself, who was very handsome, except in the sense of the homely adage, 'handsome is, that handsome does' - for he was strongly suspected of having beaten Miss Betsey, and even of having once, on a disputed question of supplies, made some hasty but determined arrangements to throw her out of a two pair of stairs' window.</s> <s sid="24" id="DC.c1.s24">These evidences of an incompatibility of temper induced Miss Betsey to pay him off, and effect a separation by mutual consent.</s> <s sid="25" id="DC.c1.s25">He went to India with his capital, and there, according to a wild legend in our family, he was once seen riding on an elephant, in company with a Baboon; but I think it must have been a Baboo - or a Begum.</s> <s sid="26" id="DC.c1.s26">Anyhow, from India tidings of his death reached home, within ten years.</s> <s sid="27" id="DC.c1.s27">How they affected my aunt, nobody knew; for immediately upon the separation, she took her maiden name again, bought a cottage in a hamlet on the sea-coast a long way off, established herself there as a single woman with one servant, and was understood to live secluded, ever afterwards, in an inflexible retirement.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="DC.c1.p8"><s sid="28" id="DC.c1.s28">My father had once been a favourite of hers, I believe; but she was mortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground that my mother was 'a wax doll'.</s> <s sid="29" id="DC.c1.s29">She had never seen my mother, but she knew her to be not yet twenty.</s> <s sid="30" id="DC.c1.s30">My father and Miss Betsey never met again.</s> <s sid="31" id="DC.c1.s31">He was double my mother's age when he married, and of but a delicate constitution.</s> <s sid="32" id="DC.c1.s32">He died a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six months before I came into the world.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="DC.c1.p9"><s sid="33" id="DC.c1.s33">This was the state of matters, on the afternoon of, what I may be excused for calling, that eventful and important Friday.</s> <s sid="34" id="DC.c1.s34">I can make no claim therefore to have known, at that time, how matters stood; or to have any remembrance, founded on the evidence of my own senses, of what follows.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="DC.c1.p10"><s sid="35" id="DC.c1.s35">My mother was sitting by the fire, but poorly in health, and very low in spirits, looking at it through her tears, and desponding heavily about herself and the fatherless little stranger, who was already welcomed by some grosses of prophetic pins, in a drawer upstairs, to a world not at all excited on the subject of his arrival; my mother, I say, was sitting by the fire, that bright, windy March afternoon, very timid and sad, and very doubtful of ever coming alive out of the trial that was before her, when, lifting her eyes as she dried them, to the window opposite, she saw a strange lady coming up the garden.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="DC.c1.p11"><s sid="36" id="DC.c1.s36">MY mother had a sure foreboding at the second glance, that it was Miss Betsey.</s> <s sid="37" id="DC.c1.s37">The setting sun was glowing on the strange lady, over the garden-fence, and she came walking up to the door with a fell rigidity of figure and composure of countenance that could have belonged to nobody else.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="DC.c1.p12"><s sid="38" id="DC.c1.s38">When she reached the house, she gave another proof of her identity.</s> <s sid="39" id="DC.c1.s39">My father had often hinted that she seldom conducted herself like any ordinary Christian; and now, instead of ringing the bell, she came and looked in at that identical window, pressing the end of her nose against the glass to that extent, that my poor dear mother used to say it became perfectly flat and white in a moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="DC.c1.p13"><s sid="40" id="DC.c1.s40">She gave my mother such a turn, that I have always been convinced I am indebted to Miss Betsey for having been born on a Friday.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="DC.c1.p14"><s sid="41" id="DC.c1.s41">My mother had left her chair in her agitation, and gone behind it in the corner.</s> <s sid="42" id="DC.c1.s42">Miss Betsey, looking round the room, slowly and inquiringly, began on the other side, and carried her eyes on, like a Saracen's Head in a Dutch clock, until they reached my mother.</s> <s sid="43" id="DC.c1.s43">Then she made a frown and a gesture to my mother, like one who was accustomed to be obeyed, to come and open the door.</s> <s sid="44" id="DC.c1.s44">My mother went.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="DC.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="DC.c1.s45"><qs/>'Mrs. David Copperfield, I think,'<qe/> said Miss Betsey; the emphasis referring, perhaps, to my mother's mourning weeds, and her condition.</s> </p><p pid="16" id="DC.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="DC.c1.s46"><qs/>'Yes,'<qe/> said my mother, faintly.</s> </p><p pid="17" id="DC.c1.p17" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="DC.c1.s47"><qs/>'Miss Trotwood,'<qe/> said the visitor.</s> <s sid="48" id="DC.c1.s48"><qs/>'You have heard of her, I dare say?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="18" id="DC.c1.p18"><s sid="49" id="DC.c1.s49">My mother answered she had had that pleasure.</s> <s sid="50" id="DC.c1.s50">And she had a disagreeable consciousness of not appearing to imply that it had been an overpowering pleasure.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="DC.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="DC.c1.s51"><qs/>'Now you see her,'<qe/> said Miss Betsey.</s> <s sid="52" id="DC.c1.s52">My mother bent her head, and begged her to walk in.</s> </p><p pid="20" id="DC.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="DC.c1.s53">They went into the parlour my mother had come from, the fire in the best room on the other side of the passage not being lighted - not having been lighted, indeed, since my father's funeral; and when they were both seated, and Miss Betsey said nothing, my mother, after vainly trying to restrain herself, began to cry.</s> <s sid="54" id="DC.c1.s54"><qs/>'Oh tut, tut, tut!'<qe/> said Miss Betsey, in a hurry.</s> <s sid="55" id="DC.c1.s55"><qs/>'Don't do that!</s> <s sid="56" id="DC.c1.s56">Come, come!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="21" id="DC.c1.p21"><s sid="57" id="DC.c1.s57">My mother couldn't help it notwithstanding, so she cried until she had had her cry out.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="DC.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="DC.c1.s58"><qs/>'Take off your cap, child,'<qe/><sss/> said Miss Betsey, <sse/><qs/>'and let me see you.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="DC.c1.p23"><s sid="59" id="DC.c1.s59">MY mother was too much afraid of her to refuse compliance with this odd request, if she had any disposition to do so.</s> <s sid="60" id="DC.c1.s60">Therefore she did as she was told, and did it with such nervous hands that her hair (which was luxuriant and beautiful) fell all about her face.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="DC.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="DC.c1.s61"><qs/>'Why, bless my heart!'<qe/> exclaimed Miss Betsey.</s> <s sid="62" id="DC.c1.s62"><qs/>'You are a very Baby!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="DC.c1.p25"><s sid="63" id="DC.c1.s63">My mother was, no doubt, unusually youthful in appearance even for her years; she hung her head, as if it were her fault, poor thing, and said, sobbing, that indeed she was afraid she was but a childish widow, and would be but a childish mother if she lived.</s> <s sid="64" id="DC.c1.s64">In a short pause which ensued, she had a fancy that she felt Miss Betsey touch her hair, and that with no ungentle hand; but, looking at her, in her timid hope, she found that lady sitting with the skirt of her dress tucked up, her hands folded on one knee, and her feet upon the fender, frowning at the fire.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="DC.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="65" id="DC.c1.s65"><qs/>'In the name of Heaven,'<qe/><sss/> said Miss Betsey, suddenly, <sse/><qs/>'why Rookery?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="27" id="DC.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="DC.c1.s66"><qs/>'Do you mean the house, ma'am?'<qe/> asked my mother.</s> </p><p pid="28" id="DC.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="DC.c1.s67"><qs/>'Why Rookery?'<qe/> said Miss Betsey.</s> <s sid="68" id="DC.c1.s68"><qs/>'Cookery would have been more to the purpose, if you had had any practical ideas of life, either of you.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="29" id="DC.c1.p29" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="DC.c1.s69"><qs/>'The name was Mr. Copperfield's choice,'<qe/> returned my mother.</s> <s sid="70" id="DC.c1.s70"><qs/>'When he bought the house, he liked to think that there were rooks about it.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="30" id="DC.c1.p30"><s sid="71" id="DC.c1.s71">The evening wind made such a disturbance just now, among some tall old elm-trees at the bottom of the garden, that neither my mother nor Miss Betsey could forbear glancing that way.</s> <s sid="72" id="DC.c1.s72">As the elms bent to one another, like giants who were whispering secrets, and after a few seconds of such repose, fell into a violent flurry, tossing their wild arms about, as if their late confidences were really too wicked for their peace of mind, some weatherbeaten ragged old rooks'-nests, burdening their higher branches, swung like wrecks upon a stormy sea.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 2 I OBSERVE</title>

<p pid="1" id="DC.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="DC.c2.s1">The first objects that assume a distinct presence before me, as I look far back, into the blank of my infancy, are my mother with her pretty hair and youthful shape, and Peggotty with no shape at all, and eyes so dark that they seemed to darken their whole neighbourhood in her face, and cheeks and arms so hard and red that I wondered the birds didn't peck her in preference to apples.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c2.p2"><s sid="2" id="DC.c2.s2">I believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart, dwarfed to my sight by stooping down or kneeling on the floor, and I going unsteadily from the one to the other.</s> <s sid="3" id="DC.c2.s3">I have an impression on my mind which I cannot distinguish from actual remembrance, of the touch of Peggotty's forefinger as she used to hold it out to me, and of its being roughened by needlework, like a pocket nutmeg-grater.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DC.c2.p3"><s sid="4" id="DC.c2.s4">This may be fancy, though I think the memory of most of us can go farther back into such times than many of us suppose; just as I believe the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite wonderful for its closeness and accuracy.</s> <s sid="5" id="DC.c2.s5">Indeed, I think that most grown men who are remarkable in this respect, may with greater propriety be said not to have lost the faculty, than to have acquired it; the rather, as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness, and gentleness, and capacity of being pleased, which are also an inheritance they have preserved from their childhood.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DC.c2.p4"><s sid="6" id="DC.c2.s6">I might have a misgiving that I am 'meandering' in stopping to say this, but that it brings me to remark that I build these conclusions, in part upon my own experience of myself; and if it should appear from anything I may set down in this narrative that I was a child of close observation, or that as a man I have a strong memory of my childhood, I undoubtedly lay claim to both of these characteristics.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DC.c2.p5"><s sid="7" id="DC.c2.s7">Looking back, as I was saying, into the blank of my infancy, the first objects I can remember as standing out by themselves from a confusion of things, are my mother and Peggotty.</s> <s sid="8" id="DC.c2.s8">What else do I remember?</s> <s sid="9" id="DC.c2.s9">Let me see.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DC.c2.p6"><s sid="10" id="DC.c2.s10">There comes out of the cloud, our house - not new to me, but quite familiar, in its earliest remembrance.</s> <s sid="11" id="DC.c2.s11">On the ground-floor is Peggotty's kitchen, opening into a back yard; with a pigeon-house on a pole, in the centre, without any pigeons in it; a great dog- kennel in a corner, without any dog; and a quantity of fowls that look terribly tall to me, walking about, in a menacing and ferocious manner.</s> <s sid="12" id="DC.c2.s12">There is one cock who gets upon a post to crow, and seems to take particular notice of me as I look at him through the kitchen window, who makes me shiver, he is so fierce.</s> <s sid="13" id="DC.c2.s13">Of the geese outside the side-gate who come waddling after me with their long necks stretched out when I go that way, I dream at night: as a man environed by wild beasts might dream of lions.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="DC.c2.p10"><s sid="37" id="DC.c2.s37">And now I see the outside of our house, with the latticed bedroom-windows standing open to let in the sweet-smelling air, and the ragged old rooks'-nests still dangling in the elm-trees at the bottom of the front garden.</s> <s sid="38" id="DC.c2.s38">Now I am in the garden at the back, beyond the yard where the empty pigeon-house and dog-kennel are - a very preserve of butterflies, as I remember it, with a high fence, and a gate and padlock; where the fruit clusters on the trees, riper and richer than fruit has ever been since, in any other garden, and where my mother gathers some in a basket, while I stand by, bolting furtive gooseberries, and trying to look unmoved.</s> <s sid="39" id="DC.c2.s39">A great wind rises, and the summer is gone in a moment.</s> <s sid="40" id="DC.c2.s40">We are playing in the winter twilight, dancing about the parlour.</s> <s sid="41" id="DC.c2.s41">When my mother is out of breath and rests herself in an elbow-chair, I watch her winding her bright curls round her fingers, and straitening her waist, and nobody knows better than I do that she likes to look so well, and is proud of being so pretty.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c10.p2"><s sid="4" id="DC.c10.s4">As to me or my future, not a word was said, or a step taken.</s> <s sid="5" id="DC.c10.s5">Happy they would have been, I dare say, if they could have dismissed me at a month's warning too.</s> <s sid="6" id="DC.c10.s6">I mustered courage once, to ask Miss Murdstone when I was going back to school; and she answered dryly, she believed I was not going back at all.</s> <s sid="7" id="DC.c10.s7">I was told nothing more.</s> <s sid="8" id="DC.c10.s8">I was very anxious to know what was going to be done with me, and so was Peggotty; but neither she nor I could pick up any information on the subject.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DC.c10.p3"><s sid="9" id="DC.c10.s9">There was one change in my condition, which, while it relieved me of a great deal of present uneasiness, might have made me, if I had been capable of considering it closely, yet more uncomfortable about the future.</s> <s sid="10" id="DC.c10.s10">It was this.</s> <s sid="11" id="DC.c10.s11">The constraint that had been put upon me, was quite abandoned.</s> <s sid="12" id="DC.c10.s12">I was so far from being required to keep my dull post in the parlour, that on several occasions, when I took my seat there, Miss Murdstone frowned to me to go away.</s> <s sid="13" id="DC.c10.s13">I was so far from being warned off from Peggotty's society, that, provided I was not in Mr. Murdstone's, I was never sought out or inquired for.</s> <s sid="14" id="DC.c10.s14">At first I was in daily dread of his taking my education in hand again, or of Miss Murdstone's devoting herself to it; but I soon began to think that such fears were groundless, and that all I had to anticipate was neglect.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DC.c10.p4"><s sid="15" id="DC.c10.s15">I do not conceive that this discovery gave me much pain then.</s> <s sid="16" id="DC.c10.s16">I was still giddy with the shock of my mother's death, and in a kind of stunned state as to all tributary things.</s> <s sid="17" id="DC.c10.s17">I can recollect, indeed, to have speculated, at odd times, on the possibility of my not being taught any more, or cared for any more; and growing up to be a shabby, moody man, lounging an idle life away, about the village; as well as on the feasibility of my getting rid of this picture by going away somewhere, like the hero in a story, to seek my fortune: but these were transient visions, daydreams I sat looking at sometimes, as if they were faintly painted or written on the wall of my room, and which, as they melted away, left the wall blank again.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="DC.c10.p22" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="DC.c10.s50"><qs/>'The boy will be idle there,'<qe/><sls/> said Miss Murdstone, looking into a pickle-jar, <sle/><qs/>'and idleness is the root of all evil.</s> <s sid="51" id="DC.c10.s51">But, to be sure, he would be idle here - or anywhere, in my opinion.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="DC.c10.p23"><s sid="52" id="DC.c10.s52">Peggotty had an angry answer ready, I could see; but she swallowed it for my sake, and remained silent.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="DC.c10.p24" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="DC.c10.s53"><qs/>'Humph!'<qe/><sls/> said Miss Murdstone, still keeping her eye on the pickles; <sle/><qs/>'it is of more importance than anything else - it is of paramount importance - that my brother should not be disturbed or made uncomfortable.</s> <s sid="54" id="DC.c10.s54">I suppose I had better say yes.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="DC.c10.p25"><s sid="55" id="DC.c10.s55">I thanked her, without making any demonstration of joy, lest it should induce her to withdraw her assent.</s> <s sid="56" id="DC.c10.s56">Nor could I help thinking this a prudent course, since she looked at me out of the pickle-jar, with as great an access of sourness as if her black eyes had absorbed its contents.</s> <s sid="57" id="DC.c10.s57">However, the permission was given, and was never retracted; for when the month was out, Peggotty and I were ready to depart.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="DC.c10.p26"><s sid="58" id="DC.c10.s58">Mr. Barkis came into the house for Peggotty's boxes.</s> <s sid="59" id="DC.c10.s59">I had never known him to pass the garden-gate before, but on this occasion he came into the house.</s> <s sid="60" id="DC.c10.s60">And he gave me a look as he shouldered the largest box and went out, which I thought had meaning in it, if meaning could ever be said to find its way into Mr. Barkis's visage.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="DC.c10.p27"><s sid="61" id="DC.c10.s61">Peggotty was naturally in low spirits at leaving what had been her home so many years, and where the two strong attachments of her life - for my mother and myself - had been formed.</s> <s sid="62" id="DC.c10.s62">She had been walking in the churchyard, too, very early; and she got into the cart, and sat in it with her handkerchief at her eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="DC.c10.p28"><s sid="63" id="DC.c10.s63">So long as she remained in this condition, Mr. Barkis gave no sign of life whatever.</s> <s sid="64" id="DC.c10.s64">He sat in his usual place and attitude like a great stuffed figure.</s> <s sid="65" id="DC.c10.s65">But when she began to look about her, and to speak to me, he nodded his head and grinned several times.</s> <s sid="66" id="DC.c10.s66">I have not the least notion at whom, or what he meant by it.</s> </p>

<p pid="38" id="DC.c10.p38" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="DC.c10.s82">Peggotty calling his attention to my sufferings, Mr. Barkis gave me a little more room at once, and got away by degrees.</s> <s sid="83" id="DC.c10.s83">But I could not help observing that he seemed to think he had hit upon a wonderful expedient for expressing himself in a neat, agreeable, and pointed manner, without the inconvenience of inventing conversation.</s> <s sid="84" id="DC.c10.s84">He manifestly chuckled over it for some time.</s> <s sid="85" id="DC.c10.s85">By and by he turned to Peggotty again, and repeating, <qs/>'Are you pretty comfortable though?'<qe/> bore down upon us as before, until the breath was nearly edged out of my body.</s> <s sid="86" id="DC.c10.s86">By and by he made another descent upon us with the same inquiry, and the same result.</s> <s sid="87" id="DC.c10.s87">At length, I got up whenever I saw him coming, and standing on the foot-board, pretended to look at the prospect; after which I did very well.</s> </p><p pid="39" id="DC.c10.p39"><s sid="88" id="DC.c10.s88">He was so polite as to stop at a public-house, expressly on our account, and entertain us with broiled mutton and beer.</s> <s sid="89" id="DC.c10.s89">Even when Peggotty was in the act of drinking, he was seized with one of those approaches, and almost choked her.</s> <s sid="90" id="DC.c10.s90">But as we drew nearer to the end of our journey, he had more to do and less time for gallantry; and when we got on Yarmouth pavement, we were all too much shaken and jolted, I apprehend, to have any leisure for anything else.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="DC.c10.p40"><s sid="91" id="DC.c10.s91">Mr. Peggotty and Ham waited for us at the old place.</s> <s sid="92" id="DC.c10.s92">They received me and Peggotty in an affectionate manner, and shook hands with Mr. Barkis, who, with his hat on the very back of his head, and a shame-faced leer upon his countenance, and pervading his very legs, presented but a vacant appearance, I thought.</s> <s sid="93" id="DC.c10.s93">They each took one of Peggotty's trunks, and we were going away, when Mr. Barkis solemnly made a sign to me with his forefinger to come under an archway.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DC.c15.p1"><s sid="1" id="DC.c15.s1">Mr. Dick and I soon became the best of friends, and very often, when his day's work was done, went out together to fly the great kite.</s> <s sid="2" id="DC.c15.s2">Every day of his life he had a long sitting at the Memorial, which never made the least progress, however hard he laboured, for King Charles the First always strayed into it, sooner or later, and then it was thrown aside, and another one begun.</s> <s sid="3" id="DC.c15.s3">The patience and hope with which he bore these perpetual disappointments, the mild perception he had that there was something wrong about King Charles the First, the feeble efforts he made to keep him out, and the certainty with which he came in, and tumbled the Memorial out of all shape, made a deep impression on me.</s> <s sid="4" id="DC.c15.s4">What Mr. Dick supposed would come of the Memorial, if it were completed; where he thought it was to go, or what he thought it was to do; he knew no more than anybody else, I believe.</s> <s sid="5" id="DC.c15.s5">Nor was it at all necessary that he should trouble himself with such questions, for if anything were certain under the sun, it was certain that the Memorial never would be finished.</s> <s sid="6" id="DC.c15.s6">It was quite an affecting sight, I used to think, to see him with the kite when it was up a great height in the air.</s> <s sid="7" id="DC.c15.s7">What he had told me, in his room, about his belief in its disseminating the statements pasted on it, which were nothing but old leaves of abortive Memorials, might have been a fancy with him sometimes; but not when he was out, looking up at the kite in the sky, and feeling it pull and tug at his hand.</s> <s sid="8" id="DC.c15.s8">He never looked so serene as he did then.</s> <s sid="9" id="DC.c15.s9">I used to fancy, as I sat by him of an evening, on a green slope, and saw him watch the kite high in the quiet air, that it lifted his mind out of its confusion, and bore it (such was my boyish thought) into the skies.</s> <s sid="10" id="DC.c15.s10">As he wound the string in and it came lower and lower down out of the beautiful light, until it fluttered to the ground, and lay there like a dead thing, he seemed to wake gradually out of a dream; and I remember to have seen him take it up, and look about him in a lost way, as if they had both come down together, so that I pitied him with all my heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="DC.c15.p19"><s sid="41" id="DC.c15.s41">At length we stopped before a very old house bulging out over the road; a house with long low lattice-windows bulging out still farther, and beams with carved heads on the ends bulging out too, so that I fancied the whole house was leaning forward, trying to see who was passing on the narrow pavement below.</s> <s sid="42" id="DC.c15.s42">It was quite spotless in its cleanliness.</s> <s sid="43" id="DC.c15.s43">The old-fashioned brass knocker on the low arched door, ornamented with carved garlands of fruit and flowers, twinkled like a star; the two stone steps descending to the door were as white as if they had been covered with fair linen; and all the angles and corners, and carvings and mouldings, and quaint little panes of glass, and quainter little windows, though as old as the hills, were as pure as any snow that ever fell upon the hills.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="DC.c15.p20"><s sid="44" id="DC.c15.s44">When the pony-chaise stopped at the door, and my eyes were intent upon the house, I saw a cadaverous face appear at a small window on the ground floor (in a little round tower that formed one side of the house), and quickly disappear.</s> <s sid="45" id="DC.c15.s45">The low arched door then opened, and the face came out.</s> <s sid="46" id="DC.c15.s46">It was quite as cadaverous as it had looked in the window, though in the grain of it there was that tinge of red which is sometimes to be observed in the skins of red-haired people.</s> <s sid="47" id="DC.c15.s47">It belonged to a red-haired person - a youth of fifteen, as I take it now, but looking much older - whose hair was cropped as close as the closest stubble; who had hardly any eyebrows, and no eyelashes, and eyes of a red-brown, so unsheltered and unshaded, that I remember wondering how he went to sleep.</s> <s sid="48" id="DC.c15.s48">He was high-shouldered and bony; dressed in decent black, with a white wisp of a neckcloth; buttoned up to the throat; and had a long, lank, skeleton hand, which particularly attracted my attention, as he stood at the pony's head, rubbing his chin with it, and looking up at us in the chaise.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="DC.c15.p24"><s sid="53" id="DC.c15.s53">I believe I was turning about in search of Uriah's picture, when, a door at the farther end of the room opening, a gentleman entered, at sight of whom I turned to the first-mentioned portrait again, to make quite sure that it had not come out of its frame.</s> <s sid="54" id="DC.c15.s54">But it was stationary; and as the gentleman advanced into the light, I saw that he was some years older than when he had had his picture painted.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DC.c17.p1"><s sid="1" id="DC.c17.s1">It has not occurred to me to mention Peggotty since I ran away; but, of course, I wrote her a letter almost as soon as I was housed at Dover, and another, and a longer letter, containing all particulars fully related, when my aunt took me formally under her protection.</s> <s sid="2" id="DC.c17.s2">On my being settled at Doctor Strong's I wrote to her again, detailing my happy condition and prospects.</s> <s sid="3" id="DC.c17.s3">I never could have derived anything like the pleasure from spending the money Mr. Dick had given me, that I felt in sending a gold half-guinea to Peggotty, per post, enclosed in this last letter, to discharge the sum I had borrowed of her: in which epistle, not before, I mentioned about the young man with the donkey-cart.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c17.p2"><s sid="4" id="DC.c17.s4">To these communications Peggotty replied as promptly, if not as concisely, as a merchant's clerk.</s> <s sid="5" id="DC.c17.s5">Her utmost powers of expression (which were certainly not great in ink) were exhausted in the attempt to write what she felt on the subject of my journey.</s> <s sid="6" id="DC.c17.s6">Four sides of incoherent and interjectional beginnings of sentences, that had no end, except blots, were inadequate to afford her any relief.</s> <s sid="7" id="DC.c17.s7">But the blots were more expressive to me than the best composition; for they showed me that Peggotty had been crying all over the paper, and what could I have desired more?</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DC.c17.p3"><s sid="8" id="DC.c17.s8">I made out, without much difficulty, that she could not take quite kindly to my aunt yet.</s> <s sid="9" id="DC.c17.s9">The notice was too short after so long a prepossession the other way.</s> <s sid="10" id="DC.c17.s10">We never knew a person, she wrote; but to think that Miss Betsey should seem to be so different from what she had been thought to be, was a Moral!</s> <s sid="11" id="DC.c17.s11">- that was her word.</s> <s sid="12" id="DC.c17.s12">She was evidently still afraid of Miss Betsey, for she sent her grateful duty to her but timidly; and she was evidently afraid of me, too, and entertained the probability of my running away again soon: if I might judge from the repeated hints she threw out, that the coach-fare to Yarmouth was always to be had of her for the asking.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DC.c17.p4"><s sid="13" id="DC.c17.s13">She gave me one piece of intelligence which affected me very much, namely, that there had been a sale of the furniture at our old home, and that Mr. and Miss Murdstone were gone away, and the house was shut up, to be let or sold.</s> <s sid="14" id="DC.c17.s14">God knows I had no part in it while they remained there, but it pained me to think of the dear old place as altogether abandoned; of the weeds growing tall in the garden, and the fallen leaves lying thick and wet upon the paths.</s> <s sid="15" id="DC.c17.s15">I imagined how the winds of winter would howl round it, how the cold rain would beat upon the window-glass, how the moon would make ghosts on the walls of the empty rooms, watching their solitude all night.</s> <s sid="16" id="DC.c17.s16">I thought afresh of the grave in the churchyard, underneath the tree: and it seemed as if the house were dead too, now, and all connected with my father and mother were faded away.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DC.c17.p5"><s sid="17" id="DC.c17.s17">There was no other news in Peggotty's letters.</s> <s sid="18" id="DC.c17.s18">Mr. Barkis was an excellent husband, she said, though still a little near; but we all had our faults, and she had plenty (though I am sure I don't know what they were); and he sent his duty, and my little bedroom was always ready for me.</s> <s sid="19" id="DC.c17.s19">Mr. Peggotty was well, and Ham was well, and Mrs..</s> <s sid="20" id="DC.c17.s20">Gummidge was but poorly, and little Em'ly wouldn't send her love, but said that Peggotty might send it, if she liked.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DC.c17.p6"><s sid="21" id="DC.c17.s21">All this intelligence I dutifully imparted to my aunt, only reserving to myself the mention of little Em'ly, to whom I instinctively felt that she would not very tenderly incline.</s> <s sid="22" id="DC.c17.s22">While I was yet new at Doctor Strong's, she made several excursions over to Canterbury to see me, and always at unseasonable hours: with the view, I suppose, of taking me by surprise.</s> <s sid="23" id="DC.c17.s23">But, finding me well employed, and bearing a good character, and hearing on all hands that I rose fast in the school, she soon discontinued these visits.</s> <s sid="24" id="DC.c17.s24">I saw her on a Saturday, every third or fourth week, when I went over to Dover for a treat; and I saw Mr. Dick every alternate Wednesday, when he arrived by stage-coach at noon, to stay until next morning.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DC.c17.p7"><s sid="25" id="DC.c17.s25">On these occasions Mr. Dick never travelled without a leathern writing-desk, containing a supply of stationery and the Memorial; in relation to which document he had a notion that time was beginning to press now, and that it really must be got out of hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="DC.c17.p8"><s sid="26" id="DC.c17.s26">Mr. Dick was very partial to gingerbread.</s> <s sid="27" id="DC.c17.s27">To render his visits the more agreeable, my aunt had instructed me to open a credit for him at a cake shop, which was hampered with the stipulation that he should not be served with more than one shilling's-worth in the course of any one day.</s> <s sid="28" id="DC.c17.s28">This, and the reference of all his little bills at the county inn where he slept, to my aunt, before they were paid, induced me to suspect that he was only allowed to rattle his money, and not to spend it.</s> <s sid="29" id="DC.c17.s29">I found on further investigation that this was so, or at least there was an agreement between him and my aunt that he should account to her for all his disbursements.</s> <s sid="30" id="DC.c17.s30">As he had no idea of deceiving her, and always desired to please her, he was thus made chary of launching into expense.</s> <s sid="31" id="DC.c17.s31">On this point, as well as on all other possible points, Mr. Dick was convinced that my aunt was the wisest and most wonderful of women; as he repeatedly told me with infinite secrecy, and always in a whisper.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="DC.c17.p32"><s sid="78" id="DC.c17.s78">These Wednesdays were the happiest days of Mr. Dick's life; they were far from being the least happy of mine.</s> <s sid="79" id="DC.c17.s79">He soon became known to every boy in the school; and though he never took an active part in any game but kite-flying, was as deeply interested in all our sports as anyone among us.</s> <s sid="80" id="DC.c17.s80">How often have I seen him, intent upon a match at marbles or pegtop, looking on with a face of unutterable interest, and hardly breathing at the critical times!</s> <s sid="81" id="DC.c17.s81">How often, at hare and hounds, have I seen him mounted on a little knoll, cheering the whole field on to action, and waving his hat above his grey head, oblivious of King Charles the Martyr's head, and all belonging to it!</s> <s sid="82" id="DC.c17.s82">How many a summer hour have I known to be but blissful minutes to him in the cricket-field!</s> <s sid="83" id="DC.c17.s83">How many winter days have I seen him, standing blue-nosed, in the snow and east wind, looking at the boys going down the long slide, and clapping his worsted gloves in rapture!</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="DC.c17.p33"><s sid="84" id="DC.c17.s84">He was an universal favourite, and his ingenuity in little things was transcendent.</s> <s sid="85" id="DC.c17.s85">He could cut oranges into such devices as none of us had an idea of.</s> <s sid="86" id="DC.c17.s86">He could make a boat out of anything, from a skewer upwards.</s> <s sid="87" id="DC.c17.s87">He could turn cramp-bones into chessmen; fashion Roman chariots from old court cards; make spoked wheels out of cotton reels, and bird-cages of old wire.</s> <s sid="88" id="DC.c17.s88">But he was greatest of all, perhaps, in the articles of string and straw; with which we were all persuaded he could do anything that could be done by hands.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="DC.c17.p34"><s sid="89" id="DC.c17.s89">Mr. Dick's renown was not long confined to us.</s> <s sid="90" id="DC.c17.s90">After a few Wednesdays, Doctor Strong himself made some inquiries of me about him, and I told him all my aunt had told me; which interested the Doctor so much that he requested, on the occasion of his next visit, to be presented to him.</s> <s sid="91" id="DC.c17.s91">This ceremony I performed; and the Doctor begging Mr. Dick, whensoever he should not find me at the coach office, to come on there, and rest himself until our morning's work was over, it soon passed into a custom for Mr. Dick to come on as a matter of course, and, if we were a little late, as often happened on a Wednesday, to walk about the courtyard, waiting for me.</s> <s sid="92" id="DC.c17.s92">Here he made the acquaintance of the Doctor's beautiful young wife (paler than formerly, all this time; more rarely seen by me or anyone, I think; and not so gay, but not less beautiful), and so became more and more familiar by degrees, until, at last, he would come into the school and wait.</s> <s sid="93" id="DC.c17.s93">He always sat in a particular corner, on a particular stool, which was called 'Dick', after him; here he would sit, with his grey head bent forward, attentively listening to whatever might be going on, with a profound veneration for the learning he had never been able to acquire.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="DC.c17.p35"><s sid="94" id="DC.c17.s94">This veneration Mr. Dick extended to the Doctor, whom he thought the most subtle and accomplished philosopher of any age.</s> <s sid="95" id="DC.c17.s95">It was long before Mr. Dick ever spoke to him otherwise than bareheaded; and even when he and the Doctor had struck up quite a friendship, and would walk together by the hour, on that side of the courtyard which was known among us as The Doctor's Walk, Mr. Dick would pull off his hat at intervals to show his respect for wisdom and knowledge.</s> <s sid="96" id="DC.c17.s96">How it ever came about that the Doctor began to read out scraps of the famous Dictionary, in these walks, I never knew; perhaps he felt it all the same, at first, as reading to himself.</s> <s sid="97" id="DC.c17.s97">However, it passed into a custom too; and Mr. Dick, listening with a face shining with pride and pleasure, in his heart of hearts believed the Dictionary to be the most delightful book in the world.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="DC.c17.p36"><s sid="98" id="DC.c17.s98">As I think of them going up and down before those schoolroom windows - the Doctor reading with his complacent smile, an occasional flourish of the manuscript, or grave motion of his head; and Mr. Dick listening, enchained by interest, with his poor wits calmly wandering God knows where, upon the wings of hard words - I think of it as one of the pleasantest things, in a quiet way, that I have ever seen.</s> <s sid="99" id="DC.c17.s99">I feel as if they might go walking to and fro for ever, and the world might somehow be the better for it - as if a thousand things it makes a noise about, were not one half so good for it, or me.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DC.c20.p1"><s sid="1" id="DC.c20.s1">When the chambermaid tapped at my door at eight o'clock, and informed me that my shaving-water was outside, I felt severely the having no occasion for it, and blushed in my bed.</s> <s sid="2" id="DC.c20.s2">The suspicion that she laughed too, when she said it, preyed upon my mind all the time I was dressing; and gave me, I was conscious, a sneaking and guilty air when I passed her on the staircase, as I was going down to breakfast.</s> <s sid="3" id="DC.c20.s3">I was so sensitively aware, indeed, of being younger than I could have wished, that for some time I could not make up my mind to pass her at all, under the ignoble circumstances of the case; but, hearing her there with a broom, stood peeping out of window at King Charles on horseback, surrounded by a maze of hackney-coaches, and looking anything but regal in a drizzling rain and a dark-brown fog, until I was admonished by the waiter that the gentleman was waiting for me.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c20.p2"><s sid="4" id="DC.c20.s4">It was not in the coffee-room that I found Steerforth expecting me, but in a snug private apartment, red-curtained and Turkey-carpeted, where the fire burnt bright, and a fine hot breakfast was set forth on a table covered with a clean cloth; and a cheerful miniature of the room, the fire, the breakfast, Steerforth, and all, was shining in the little round mirror over the sideboard.</s> <s sid="5" id="DC.c20.s5">I was rather bashful at first, Steerforth being so self-possessed, and elegant, and superior to me in all respects (age included); but his easy patronage soon put that to rights, and made me quite at home.</s> <s sid="6" id="DC.c20.s6">I could not enough admire the change he had wrought in the Golden Cross; or compare the dull forlorn state I had held yesterday, with this morning's comfort and this morning's entertainment.</s> <s sid="7" id="DC.c20.s7">As to the waiter's familiarity, it was quenched as if it had never been.</s> <s sid="8" id="DC.c20.s8">He attended on us, as I may say, in sackcloth and ashes.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="DC.c20.p17" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="DC.c20.s38">Lunch succeeded to our sight-seeing, and the short winter day wore away so fast, that it was dusk when the stage-coach stopped with us at an old brick house at Highgate on the summit of the hill.</s> <s sid="39" id="DC.c20.s39">An elderly lady, though not very far advanced in years, with a proud carriage and a handsome face, was in the doorway as we alighted; and greeting Steerforth as <qs/>'My dearest James,'<qe/> folded him in her arms.</s> <s sid="40" id="DC.c20.s40">To this lady he presented me as his mother, and she gave me a stately welcome.</s> </p><p pid="18" id="DC.c20.p18"><s sid="41" id="DC.c20.s41">It was a genteel old-fashioned house, very quiet and orderly.</s> <s sid="42" id="DC.c20.s42">From the windows of my room I saw all London lying in the distance like a great vapour, with here and there some lights twinkling through it.</s> <s sid="43" id="DC.c20.s43">I had only time, in dressing, to glance at the solid furniture, the framed pieces of work (done, I supposed, by Steerforth's mother when she was a girl), and some pictures in crayons of ladies with powdered hair and bodices, coming and going on the walls, as the newly-kindled fire crackled and sputtered, when I was called to dinner.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="DC.c20.p19"><s sid="44" id="DC.c20.s44">There was a second lady in the dining-room, of a slight short figure, dark, and not agreeable to look at, but with some appearance of good looks too, who attracted my attention: perhaps because I had not expected to see her; perhaps because I found myself sitting opposite to her; perhaps because of something really remarkable in her.</s> <s sid="45" id="DC.c20.s45">She had black hair and eager black eyes, and was thin, and had a scar upon her lip.</s> <s sid="46" id="DC.c20.s46">It was an old scar - I should rather call it seam, for it was not discoloured, and had healed years ago - which had once cut through her mouth, downward towards the chin, but was now barely visible across the table, except above and on her upper lip, the shape of which it had altered.</s> <s sid="47" id="DC.c20.s47">I concluded in my own mind that she was about thirty years of age, and that she wished to be married.</s> <s sid="48" id="DC.c20.s48">She was a little dilapidated - like a house - with having been so long to let; yet had, as I have said, an appearance of good looks.</s> <s sid="49" id="DC.c20.s49">Her thinness seemed to be the effect of some wasting fire within her, which found a vent in her gaunt eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="DC.c20.p20"><s sid="50" id="DC.c20.s50">She was introduced as Miss Dartle, and both Steerforth and his mother called her Rosa.</s> <s sid="51" id="DC.c20.s51">I found that she lived there, and had been for a long time Mrs. Steerforth's companion.</s> <s sid="52" id="DC.c20.s52">It appeared to me that she never said anything she wanted to say, outright; but hinted it, and made a great deal more of it by this practice.</s> <s sid="53" id="DC.c20.s53">For example, when Mrs. Steerforth observed, more in jest than earnest, that she feared her son led but a wild life at college, Miss Dartle put in thus:</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c21.p2"><s sid="11" id="DC.c21.s11">Such a self-contained man I never saw.</s> <s sid="12" id="DC.c21.s12">But in that quality, as in every other he possessed, he only seemed to be the more respectable.</s> <s sid="13" id="DC.c21.s13">Even the fact that no one knew his Christian name, seemed to form a part of his respectability.</s> <s sid="14" id="DC.c21.s14">Nothing could be objected against his surname, Littimer, by which he was known.</s> <s sid="15" id="DC.c21.s15">Peter might have been hanged, or Tom transported; but Littimer was perfectly respectable.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DC.c21.p3"><s sid="16" id="DC.c21.s16">It was occasioned, I suppose, by the reverend nature of respectability in the abstract, but I felt particularly young in this man's presence.</s> <s sid="17" id="DC.c21.s17">How old he was himself, I could not guess - and that again went to his credit on the same score; for in the calmness of respectability he might have numbered fifty years as well as thirty.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DC.c21.p5"><s sid="20" id="DC.c21.s20">I gave him good morning, and asked him what o'clock it was.</s> <s sid="21" id="DC.c21.s21">He took out of his pocket the most respectable hunting-watch I ever saw, and preventing the spring with his thumb from opening far, looked in at the face as if he were consulting an oracular oyster, shut it up again, and said, if I pleased, it was half past eight.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="DC.c21.p14"><s sid="37" id="DC.c21.s37">I am particular about this man, because he made a particular effect on me at that time, and because of what took place thereafter.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c22.p2"><s sid="7" id="DC.c22.s7">Another cause of our being sometimes apart, was, that I had naturally an interest in going over to Blunderstone, and revisiting the old familiar scenes of my childhood; while Steerforth, after being there once, had naturally no great interest in going there again.</s> <s sid="8" id="DC.c22.s8">Hence, on three or four days that I can at once recall, we went our several ways after an early breakfast, and met again at a late dinner.</s> <s sid="9" id="DC.c22.s9">I had no idea how he employed his time in the interval, beyond a general knowledge that he was very popular in the place, and had twenty means of actively diverting himself where another man might not have found one.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DC.c22.p3"><s sid="10" id="DC.c22.s10">For my own part, my occupation in my solitary pilgrimages was to recall every yard of the old road as I went along it, and to haunt the old spots, of which I never tired.</s> <s sid="11" id="DC.c22.s11">I haunted them, as my memory had often done, and lingered among them as my younger thoughts had lingered when I was far away.</s> <s sid="12" id="DC.c22.s12">The grave beneath the tree, where both my parents lay - on which I had looked out, when it was my father's only, with such curious feelings of compassion, and by which I had stood, so desolate, when it was opened to receive my pretty mother and her baby - the grave which Peggotty's own faithful care had ever since kept neat, and made a garden of, I walked near, by the hour.</s> <s sid="13" id="DC.c22.s13">It lay a little off the churchyard path, in a quiet corner, not so far removed but I could read the names upon the stone as I walked to and fro, startled by the sound of the church-bell when it struck the hour, for it was like a departed voice to me.</s> <s sid="14" id="DC.c22.s14">My reflections at these times were always associated with the figure I was to make in life, and the distinguished things I was to do.</s> <s sid="15" id="DC.c22.s15">My echoing footsteps went to no other tune, but were as constant to that as if I had come home to build my castles in the air at a living mother's side.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DC.c22.p4"><s sid="16" id="DC.c22.s16">There were great changes in my old home.</s> <s sid="17" id="DC.c22.s17">The ragged nests, so long deserted by the rooks, were gone; and the trees were lopped and topped out of their remembered shapes.</s> <s sid="18" id="DC.c22.s18">The garden had run wild, and half the windows of the house were shut up.</s> <s sid="19" id="DC.c22.s19">It was occupied, but only by a poor lunatic gentleman, and the people who took care of him.</s> <s sid="20" id="DC.c22.s20">He was always sitting at my little window, looking out into the churchyard; and I wondered whether his rambling thoughts ever went upon any of the fancies that used to occupy mine, on the rosy mornings when I peeped out of that same little window in my night-clothes, and saw the sheep quietly feeding in the light of the rising sun.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DC.c22.p5"><s sid="21" id="DC.c22.s21">Our old neighbours, Mr. and Mrs. Grayper, were gone to South America, and the rain had made its way through the roof of their empty house, and stained the outer walls.</s> <s sid="22" id="DC.c22.s22">Mr. Chillip was married again to a tall, raw-boned, high-nosed wife; and they had a weazen little baby, with a heavy head that it couldn't hold up, and two weak staring eyes, with which it seemed to be always wondering why it had ever been born.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DC.c22.p6"><s sid="23" id="DC.c22.s23">It was with a singular jumble of sadness and pleasure that I used to linger about my native place, until the reddening winter sun admonished me that it was time to start on my returning walk.</s> <s sid="24" id="DC.c22.s24">But, when the place was left behind, and especially when Steerforth and I were happily seated over our dinner by a blazing fire, it was delicious to think of having been there.</s> <s sid="25" id="DC.c22.s25">So it was, though in a softened degree, when I went to my neat room at night; and, turning over the leaves of the crocodile-book (which was always there, upon a little table), remembered with a grateful heart how blest I was in having such a friend as Steerforth, such a friend as Peggotty, and such a substitute for what I had lost as my excellent and generous aunt.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DC.c22.p7"><s sid="26" id="DC.c22.s26">MY nearest way to Yarmouth, in coming back from these long walks, was by a ferry.</s> <s sid="27" id="DC.c22.s27">It landed me on the flat between the town and the sea, which I could make straight across, and so save myself a considerable circuit by the high road.</s> <s sid="28" id="DC.c22.s28">Mr. Peggotty's house being on that waste-place, and not a hundred yards out of my track, I always looked in as I went by.</s> <s sid="29" id="DC.c22.s29">Steerforth was pretty sure to be there expecting me, and we went on together through the frosty air and gathering fog towards the twinkling lights of the town.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="DC.c22.p8"><s sid="30" id="DC.c22.s30">One dark evening, when I was later than usual - for I had, that day, been making my parting visit to Blunderstone, as we were now about to return home - I found him alone in Mr. Peggotty's house, sitting thoughtfully before the fire.</s> <s sid="31" id="DC.c22.s31">He was so intent upon his own reflections that he was quite unconscious of my approach.</s> <s sid="32" id="DC.c22.s32">This, indeed, he might easily have been if he had been less absorbed, for footsteps fell noiselessly on the sandy ground outside; but even my entrance failed to rouse him.</s> <s sid="33" id="DC.c22.s33">I was standing close to him, looking at him; and still, with a heavy brow, he was lost in his meditations.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="DC.c22.p9"><s sid="34" id="DC.c22.s34">He gave such a start when I put my hand upon his shoulder, that he made me start too.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="DC.c22.p10" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="DC.c22.s35"><qs/>'You come upon me,'<qe/><sss/> he said, almost angrily, <sse/><qs/>'like a reproachful ghost!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="DC.c22.p11" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="DC.c22.s36"><qs/>'I was obliged to announce myself, somehow,'<qe/> I replied.</s> <s sid="37" id="DC.c22.s37"><qs/>'Have I called you down from the stars?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="12" id="DC.c22.p12" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="DC.c22.s38"><qs/>'No,'<qe/> he answered.</s> <s sid="39" id="DC.c22.s39"><qs/>'No.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="DC.c22.p13" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="DC.c22.s40"><qs/>'Up from anywhere, then?'<qe/> said I, taking my seat near him.</s> </p><p pid="14" id="DC.c22.p14" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="DC.c22.s41"><qs/>'I was looking at the pictures in the fire,'<qe/> he returned.</s> </p><p pid="15" id="DC.c22.p15" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="DC.c22.s42"><qs/>'But you are spoiling them for me,'<qe/> said I, as he stirred it quickly with a piece of burning wood, striking out of it a train of red-hot sparks that went careering up the little chimney, and roaring out into the air.</s> </p><p pid="16" id="DC.c22.p16" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="DC.c22.s43"><qs/>'You would not have seen them,'<qe/> he returned.</s> <s sid="44" id="DC.c22.s44"><qs/>'I detest this mongrel time, neither day nor night.</s> <s sid="45" id="DC.c22.s45">How late you are!</s> <s sid="46" id="DC.c22.s46">Where have you been?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="17" id="DC.c22.p17" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="DC.c22.s47"><qs/>'I have been taking leave of my usual walk,'<qe/> said I.</s> </p><p pid="18" id="DC.c22.p18" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="DC.c22.s48"><qs/>'And I have been sitting here,'<qe/><sls/> said Steerforth, glancing round the room, <sle/><qs/>'thinking that all the people we found so glad on the night of our coming down, might - to judge from the present wasted air of the place - be dispersed, or dead, or come to I don't know what harm.</s> <s sid="49" id="DC.c22.s49">David, I wish to God I had had a judicious father these last twenty years!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="DC.c22.p19" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="DC.c22.s50"><qs/>'My dear Steerforth, what is the matter?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="20" id="DC.c22.p20" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="DC.c22.s51"><qs/>'I wish with all my soul I had been better guided!'<qe/> he exclaimed.</s> <s sid="52" id="DC.c22.s52"><qs/>'I wish with all my soul I could guide myself better!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="21" id="DC.c22.p21"><s sid="53" id="DC.c22.s53">There was a passionate dejection in his manner that quite amazed me.</s> <s sid="54" id="DC.c22.s54">He was more unlike himself than I could have supposed possible.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="DC.c22.p22" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="DC.c22.s55"><qs/>'It would be better to be this poor Peggotty, or his lout of a nephew,'<qe/><sls/> he said, getting up and leaning moodily against the chimney-piece, with his face towards the fire, <sle/><qs/>'than to be myself, twenty times richer and twenty times wiser, and be the torment to myself that I have been, in this Devil's bark of a boat, within the last half-hour!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="DC.c22.p23"><s sid="56" id="DC.c22.s56">I was so confounded by the alteration in him, that at first I could only observe him in silence, as he stood leaning his head upon his hand, and looking gloomily down at the fire.</s> <s sid="57" id="DC.c22.s57">At length I begged him, with all the earnestness I felt, to tell me what had occurred to cross him so unusually, and to let me sympathize with him, if I could not hope to advise him.</s> <s sid="58" id="DC.c22.s58">Before I had well concluded, he began to laugh - fretfully at first, but soon with returning gaiety.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="DC.c22.p24" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="DC.c22.s59"><qs/>'Tut, it's nothing, Daisy! nothing!'<qe/> he replied.</s> <s sid="60" id="DC.c22.s60"><qs/>'I told you at the inn in London, I am heavy company for myself, sometimes.</s> <s sid="61" id="DC.c22.s61">I have been a nightmare to myself, just now - must have had one, I think.</s> <s sid="62" id="DC.c22.s62">At odd dull times, nursery tales come up into the memory, unrecognized for what they are.</s> <s sid="63" id="DC.c22.s63">I believe I have been confounding myself with the bad boy who "didn't care", and became food for lions - a grander kind of going to the dogs, I suppose.</s> <s sid="64" id="DC.c22.s64">What old women call the horrors, have been creeping over me from head to foot.</s> <s sid="65" id="DC.c22.s65">I have been afraid of myself.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="DC.c22.p25" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="DC.c22.s66"><qs/>'You are afraid of nothing else, I think,'<qe/> said I.</s> </p><p pid="26" id="DC.c22.p26" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="DC.c22.s67"><qs/>'Perhaps not, and yet may have enough to be afraid of too,'<qe/> he answered.</s> <s sid="68" id="DC.c22.s68"><qs/>'Well!</s> <s sid="69" id="DC.c22.s69">So it goes by!</s> <s sid="70" id="DC.c22.s70">I am not about to be hipped again, David; but I tell you, my good fellow, once more, that it would have been well for me (and for more than me) if I had had a steadfast and judicious father!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="27" id="DC.c22.p27"><s sid="71" id="DC.c22.s71">His face was always full of expression, but I never saw it express such a dark kind of earnestness as when he said these words, with his glance bent on the fire.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 26 I FALL INTO CAPTIVITY</title>

<p pid="1" id="DC.c26.p1"><s sid="1" id="DC.c26.s1">I saw no more of Uriah Heep, until the day when Agnes left town.</s> <s sid="2" id="DC.c26.s2">I was at the coach office to take leave of her and see her go; and there was he, returning to Canterbury by the same conveyance.</s> <s sid="3" id="DC.c26.s3">It was some small satisfaction to me to observe his spare, short-waisted, high-shouldered, mulberry-coloured great-coat perched up, in company with an umbrella like a small tent, on the edge of the back seat on the roof, while Agnes was, of course, inside; but what I underwent in my efforts to be friendly with him, while Agnes looked on, perhaps deserved that little recompense.</s> <s sid="4" id="DC.c26.s4">At the coach window, as at the dinner-party, he hovered about us without a moment's intermission, like a great vulture: gorging himself on every syllable that I said to Agnes, or Agnes said to me.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c26.p2" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="DC.c26.s5">In the state of trouble into which his disclosure by my fire had thrown me, I had thought very much of the words Agnes had used in reference to the partnership.</s> <s sid="6" id="DC.c26.s6"><qs/>'I did what I hope was right.</s> <s sid="7" id="DC.c26.s7">Feeling sure that it was necessary for papa's peace that the sacrifice should be made, I entreated him to make it.'<qe/></s> <s sid="8" id="DC.c26.s8">A miserable foreboding that she would yield to, and sustain herself by, the same feeling in reference to any sacrifice for his sake, had oppressed me ever since.</s> <s sid="9" id="DC.c26.s9">I knew how she loved him.</s> <s sid="10" id="DC.c26.s10">I knew what the devotion of her nature was.</s> <s sid="11" id="DC.c26.s11">I knew from her own lips that she regarded herself as the innocent cause of his errors, and as owing him a great debt she ardently desired to pay.</s> <s sid="12" id="DC.c26.s12">I had no consolation in seeing how different she was from this detestable Rufus with the mulberry-coloured great-coat, for I felt that in the very difference between them, in the self-denial of her pure soul and the sordid baseness of his, the greatest danger lay.</s> <s sid="13" id="DC.c26.s13">All this, doubtless, he knew thoroughly, and had, in his cunning, considered well.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="DC.c26.p3"><s sid="14" id="DC.c26.s14">Yet I was so certain that the prospect of such a sacrifice afar off, must destroy the happiness of Agnes; and I was so sure, from her manner, of its being unseen by her then, and having cast no shadow on her yet; that I could as soon have injured her, as given her any warning of what impended.</s> <s sid="15" id="DC.c26.s15">Thus it was that we parted without explanation: she waving her hand and smiling farewell from the coach window; her evil genius writhing on the roof, as if he had her in his clutches and triumphed.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DC.c26.p4"><s sid="16" id="DC.c26.s16">I could not get over this farewell glimpse of them for a long time.</s> <s sid="17" id="DC.c26.s17">When Agnes wrote to tell me of her safe arrival, I was as miserable as when I saw her going away.</s> <s sid="18" id="DC.c26.s18">Whenever I fell into a thoughtful state, this subject was sure to present itself, and all my uneasiness was sure to be redoubled.</s> <s sid="19" id="DC.c26.s19">Hardly a night passed without my dreaming of it.</s> <s sid="20" id="DC.c26.s20">It became a part of my life, and as inseparable from my life as my own head.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DC.c26.p5"><s sid="21" id="DC.c26.s21">I had ample leisure to refine upon my uneasiness: for Steerforth was at Oxford, as he wrote to me, and when I was not at the Commons, I was very much alone.</s> <s sid="22" id="DC.c26.s22">I believe I had at this time some lurking distrust of Steerforth.</s> <s sid="23" id="DC.c26.s23">I wrote to him most affectionately in reply to his, but I think I was glad, upon the whole, that he could not come to London just then.</s> <s sid="24" id="DC.c26.s24">I suspect the truth to be, that the influence of Agnes was upon me, undisturbed by the sight of him; and that it was the more powerful with me, because she had so large a share in my thoughts and interest.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DC.c26.p6"><s sid="25" id="DC.c26.s25">In the meantime, days and weeks slipped away.</s> <s sid="26" id="DC.c26.s26">I was articled to Spenlow and Jorkins.</s> <s sid="27" id="DC.c26.s27">I had ninety pounds a year (exclusive of my house-rent and sundry collateral matters) from my aunt.</s> <s sid="28" id="DC.c26.s28">My rooms were engaged for twelve months certain: and though I still found them dreary of an evening, and the evenings long, I could settle down into a state of equable low spirits, and resign myself to coffee; which I seem, on looking back, to have taken by the gallon at about this period of my existence.</s> <s sid="29" id="DC.c26.s29">At about this time, too, I made three discoveries: first, that Mrs. Crupp was a martyr to a curious disorder called 'the spazzums', which was generally accompanied with inflammation of the nose, and required to be constantly treated with peppermint; secondly, that something peculiar in the temperature of my pantry, made the brandy-bottles burst; thirdly, that I was alone in the world, and much given to record that circumstance in fragments of English versification.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DC.c26.p7"><s sid="30" id="DC.c26.s30">On the day when I was articled, no festivity took place, beyond my having sandwiches and sherry into the office for the clerks, and going alone to the theatre at night.</s> <s sid="31" id="DC.c26.s31">I went to see The Stranger, as a Doctors' Commons sort of play, and was so dreadfully cut up, that I hardly knew myself in my own glass when I got home.</s> <s sid="32" id="DC.c26.s32">Mr. Spenlow remarked, on this occasion, when we concluded our business, that he should have been happy to have seen me at his house at Norwood to celebrate our becoming connected, but for his domestic arrangements being in some disorder, on account of the expected return of his daughter from finishing her education at Paris.</s> <s sid="33" id="DC.c26.s33">But, he intimated that when she came home he should hope to have the pleasure of entertaining me.</s> <s sid="34" id="DC.c26.s34">I knew that he was a widower with one daughter, and expressed my acknowledgements.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="DC.c26.p8"><s sid="35" id="DC.c26.s35">Mr. Spenlow was as good as his word.</s> <s sid="36" id="DC.c26.s36">In a week or two, he referred to this engagement, and said, that if I would do him the favour to come down next Saturday, and stay till Monday, he would be extremely happy.</s> <s sid="37" id="DC.c26.s37">Of course I said I would do him the favour; and he was to drive me down in his phaeton, and to bring me back.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="DC.c26.p9"><s sid="38" id="DC.c26.s38">When the day arrived, my very carpet-bag was an object of veneration to the stipendiary clerks, to whom the house at Norwood was a sacred mystery.</s> <s sid="39" id="DC.c26.s39">One of them informed me that he had heard that Mr. Spenlow ate entirely off plate and china; and another hinted at champagne being constantly on draught, after the usual custom of table-beer.</s> <s sid="40" id="DC.c26.s40">The old clerk with the wig, whose name was Mr. Tiffey, had been down on business several times in the course of his career, and had on each occasion penetrated to the breakfast-parlour.</s> <s sid="41" id="DC.c26.s41">He described it as an apartment of the most sumptuous nature, and said that he had drunk brown East India sherry there, of a quality so precious as to make a man wink.</s> <s sid="42" id="DC.c26.s42">We had an adjourned cause in the Consistory that day - about excommunicating a baker who had been objecting in a vestry to a paving-rate - and as the evidence was just twice the length of Robinson Crusoe, according to a calculation I made, it was rather late in the day before we finished.</s> <s sid="43" id="DC.c26.s43">However, we got him excommunicated for six weeks, and sentenced in no end of costs; and then the baker's proctor, and the judge, and the advocates on both sides (who were all nearly related), went out of town together, and Mr. Spenlow and I drove away in the phaeton.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="DC.c26.p10"><s sid="44" id="DC.c26.s44">The phaeton was a very handsome affair; the horses arched their necks and lifted up their legs as if they knew they belonged to Doctors' Commons.</s> <s sid="45" id="DC.c26.s45">There was a good deal of competition in the Commons on all points of display, and it turned out some very choice equipages then; though I always have considered, and always shall consider, that in my time the great article of competition there was starch: which I think was worn among the proctors to as great an extent as it is in the nature of man to bear.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="DC.c26.p11"><s sid="46" id="DC.c26.s46">We were very pleasant, going down, and Mr. Spenlow gave me some hints in reference to my profession.</s> <s sid="47" id="DC.c26.s47">He said it was the genteelest profession in the world, and must on no account be confounded with the profession of a solicitor: being quite another sort of thing, infinitely more exclusive, less mechanical, and more profitable.</s> <s sid="48" id="DC.c26.s48">We took things much more easily in the Commons than they could be taken anywhere else, he observed, and that set us, as a privileged class, apart.</s> <s sid="49" id="DC.c26.s49">He said it was impossible to conceal the disagreeable fact, that we were chiefly employed by solicitors; but he gave me to understand that they were an inferior race of men, universally looked down upon by all proctors of any pretensions.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="DC.c26.p12" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="DC.c26.s50">I asked Mr. Spenlow what he considered the best sort of professional business?</s> <s sid="51" id="DC.c26.s51">He replied, that a good case of a disputed will, where there was a neat little estate of thirty or forty thousand pounds, was, perhaps, the best of all.</s> <s sid="52" id="DC.c26.s52">In such a case, he said, not only were there very pretty pickings, in the way of arguments at every stage of the proceedings, and mountains upon mountains of evidence on interrogatory and counter-interrogatory (to say nothing of an appeal lying, first to the Delegates, and then to the Lords), but, the costs being pretty sure to come out of the estate at last, both sides went at it in a lively and spirited manner, and expense was no consideration.</s> <s sid="53" id="DC.c26.s53">Then, he launched into a general eulogium on the Commons.</s> <s sid="54" id="DC.c26.s54">What was to be particularly admired (he said) in the Commons, was its compactness.</s> <s sid="55" id="DC.c26.s55">It was the most conveniently organized place in the world.</s> <s sid="56" id="DC.c26.s56">It was the complete idea of snugness.</s> <s sid="57" id="DC.c26.s57">It lay in a nutshell.</s> <s sid="58" id="DC.c26.s58">For example:</s> <s sid="59" id="DC.c26.s59">You brought a divorce case, or a restitution case, into the Consistory.</s> <s sid="60" id="DC.c26.s60">Very good.</s> <s sid="61" id="DC.c26.s61">You tried it in the Consistory.</s> <s sid="62" id="DC.c26.s62">You made a quiet little round game of it, among a family group, and you played it out at leisure.</s> <s sid="63" id="DC.c26.s63">Suppose you were not satisfied with the Consistory, what did you do then?</s> <s sid="64" id="DC.c26.s64">Why, you went into the Arches.</s> <s sid="65" id="DC.c26.s65">What was the Arches?</s> <s sid="66" id="DC.c26.s66">The same court, in the same room, with the same bar, and the same practitioners, but another judge, for there the Consistory judge could plead any court-day as an advocate.</s> <s sid="67" id="DC.c26.s67">Well, you played your round game out again.</s> <s sid="68" id="DC.c26.s68">Still you were not satisfied.</s> <s sid="69" id="DC.c26.s69">Very good.</s> <s sid="70" id="DC.c26.s70">What did you do then?</s> <s sid="71" id="DC.c26.s71">Why, you went to the Delegates.</s> <s sid="72" id="DC.c26.s72">Who were the Delegates?</s> <s sid="73" id="DC.c26.s73">Why, the Ecclesiastical Delegates were the advocates without any business, who had looked on at the round game when it was playing in both courts, and had seen the cards shuffled, and cut, and played, and had talked to all the players about it, and now came fresh, as judges, to settle the matter to the satisfaction of everybody!</s> <s sid="74" id="DC.c26.s74">Discontented people might talk of corruption in the Commons, closeness in the Commons, and the necessity of reforming the Commons, said Mr. Spenlow solemnly, in conclusion; but when the price of wheat per bushel had been highest, the Commons had been busiest; and a man might lay his hand upon his heart, and say this to the whole world, - <qs/>'Touch the Commons, and down comes the country!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="DC.c26.p13"><s sid="75" id="DC.c26.s75">I listened to all this with attention; and though, I must say, I had my doubts whether the country was quite as much obliged to the Commons as Mr. Spenlow made out, I respectfully deferred to his opinion.</s> <s sid="76" id="DC.c26.s76">That about the price of wheat per bushel, I modestly felt was too much for my strength, and quite settled the question.</s> <s sid="77" id="DC.c26.s77">I have never, to this hour, got the better of that bushel of wheat.</s> <s sid="78" id="DC.c26.s78">It has reappeared to annihilate me, all through my life, in connexion with all kinds of subjects.</s> <s sid="79" id="DC.c26.s79">I don't know now, exactly, what it has to do with me, or what right it has to crush me, on an infinite variety of occasions; but whenever I see my old friend the bushel brought in by the head and shoulders (as he always is, I observe), I give up a subject for lost.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="DC.c26.p14"><s sid="80" id="DC.c26.s80">This is a digression.</s> <s sid="81" id="DC.c26.s81">I was not the man to touch the Commons, and bring down the country.</s> <s sid="82" id="DC.c26.s82">I submissively expressed, by my silence, my acquiescence in all I had heard from my superior in years and knowledge; and we talked about The Stranger and the Drama, and the pairs of horses, until we came to Mr. Spenlow's gate.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="DC.c26.p15" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="DC.c26.s83">There was a lovely garden to Mr. Spenlow's house; and though that was not the best time of the year for seeing a garden, it was so beautifully kept, that I was quite enchanted.</s> <s sid="84" id="DC.c26.s84">There was a charming lawn, there were clusters of trees, and there were perspective walks that I could just distinguish in the dark, arched over with trellis-work, on which shrubs and flowers grew in the growing season.</s> <s sid="85" id="DC.c26.s85"><qs/>'Here Miss Spenlow walks by herself,'<qe/> I thought.</s> <s sid="86" id="DC.c26.s86"><qs/>'Dear me!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="16" id="DC.c26.p16" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="DC.c26.s87">We went into the house, which was cheerfully lighted up, and into a hall where there were all sorts of hats, caps, great-coats, plaids, gloves, whips, and walking-sticks.</s> <s sid="88" id="DC.c26.s88"><qs/>'Where is Miss Dora?'<qe/> said Mr. Spenlow to the servant.</s> <s sid="89" id="DC.c26.s89"><qs/>'Dora!'<qe/></s> <s sid="90" id="DC.c26.s90">I thought.</s> <s sid="91" id="DC.c26.s91"><qs/>'What a beautiful name!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="17" id="DC.c26.p17" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="DC.c26.s92">We turned into a room near at hand (I think it was the identical breakfast-room, made memorable by the brown East Indian sherry), and I heard a voice say, <qs/>'Mr. Copperfield, my daughter Dora, and my daughter Dora's confidential friend!'<qe/></s> <s sid="93" id="DC.c26.s93">It was, no doubt, Mr. Spenlow's voice, but I didn't know it, and I didn't care whose it was.</s> <s sid="94" id="DC.c26.s94">All was over in a moment.</s> <s sid="95" id="DC.c26.s95">I had fulfilled my destiny.</s> <s sid="96" id="DC.c26.s96">I was a captive and a slave.</s> <s sid="97" id="DC.c26.s97">I loved Dora Spenlow to distraction!</s> </p><p pid="18" id="DC.c26.p18"><s sid="98" id="DC.c26.s98">She was more than human to me.</s> <s sid="99" id="DC.c26.s99">She was a Fairy, a Sylph, I don't know what she was - anything that no one ever saw, and everything that everybody ever wanted.</s> <s sid="100" id="DC.c26.s100">I was swallowed up in an abyss of love in an instant.</s> <s sid="101" id="DC.c26.s101">There was no pausing on the brink; no looking down, or looking back; I was gone, headlong, before I had sense to say a word to her.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DC.c27.p1"><s sid="1" id="DC.c27.s1">It may have been in consequence of Mrs. Crupp's advice, and, perhaps, for no better reason than because there was a certain similarity in the sound of the word skittles and Traddles, that it came into my head, next day, to go and look after Traddles.</s> <s sid="2" id="DC.c27.s2">The time he had mentioned was more than out, and he lived in a little street near the Veterinary College at Camden Town, which was principally tenanted, as one of our clerks who lived in that direction informed me, by gentlemen students, who bought live donkeys, and made experiments on those quadrupeds in their private apartments.</s> <s sid="3" id="DC.c27.s3">Having obtained from this clerk a direction to the academic grove in question, I set out, the same afternoon, to visit my old schoolfellow.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c27.p2"><s sid="4" id="DC.c27.s4">I found that the street was not as desirable a one as I could have wished it to be, for the sake of Traddles.</s> <s sid="5" id="DC.c27.s5">The inhabitants appeared to have a propensity to throw any little trifles they were not in want of, into the road: which not only made it rank and sloppy, but untidy too, on account of the cabbage-leaves.</s> <s sid="6" id="DC.c27.s6">The refuse was not wholly vegetable either, for I myself saw a shoe, a doubled-up saucepan, a black bonnet, and an umbrella, in various stages of decomposition, as I was looking out for the number I wanted.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DC.c27.p3"><s sid="7" id="DC.c27.s7">The general air of the place reminded me forcibly of the days when I lived with Mr. and Mrs. Micawber.</s> <s sid="8" id="DC.c27.s8">An indescribable character of faded gentility that attached to the house I sought, and made it unlike all the other houses in the street - though they were all built on one monotonous pattern, and looked like the early copies of a blundering boy who was learning to make houses, and had not yet got out of his cramped brick-and-mortar pothooks - reminded me still more of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber.</s> <s sid="9" id="DC.c27.s9">Happening to arrive at the door as it was opened to the afternoon milkman, I was reminded of Mr. and Mrs. Micawber more forcibly yet.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DC.c28.p1"><s sid="1" id="DC.c28.s1">Until the day arrived on which I was to entertain my newly-found old friends, I lived principally on Dora and coffee.</s> <s sid="2" id="DC.c28.s2">In my love-lorn condition, my appetite languished; and I was glad of it, for I felt as though it would have been an act of perfidy towards Dora to have a natural relish for my dinner.</s> <s sid="3" id="DC.c28.s3">The quantity of walking exercise I took, was not in this respect attended with its usual consequence, as the disappointment counteracted the fresh air.</s> <s sid="4" id="DC.c28.s4">I have my doubts, too, founded on the acute experience acquired at this period of my life, whether a sound enjoyment of animal food can develop itself freely in any human subject who is always in torment from tight boots.</s> <s sid="5" id="DC.c28.s5">I think the extremities require to be at peace before the stomach will conduct itself with vigour.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c28.p2" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="DC.c28.s6">On the occasion of this domestic little party, I did not repeat my former extensive preparations.</s> <s sid="7" id="DC.c28.s7">I merely provided a pair of soles, a small leg of mutton, and a pigeon-pie.</s> <s sid="8" id="DC.c28.s8">Mrs. Crupp broke out into rebellion on my first bashful hint in reference to the cooking of the fish and joint, and said, with a dignified sense of injury, <qs/>'No!</s> <s sid="9" id="DC.c28.s9">No, sir!</s> <s sid="10" id="DC.c28.s10">You will not ask me sich a thing, for you are better acquainted with me than to suppose me capable of doing what I cannot do with ampial satisfaction to my own feelings!'<qe/></s> <s sid="11" id="DC.c28.s11">But, in the end, a compromise was effected; and Mrs. Crupp consented to achieve this feat, on condition that I dined from home for a fortnight afterwards.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="DC.c28.p3"><s sid="12" id="DC.c28.s12">And here I may remark, that what I underwent from Mrs. Crupp, in consequence of the tyranny she established over me, was dreadful.</s> <s sid="13" id="DC.c28.s13">I never was so much afraid of anyone.</s> <s sid="14" id="DC.c28.s14">We made a compromise of everything.</s> <s sid="15" id="DC.c28.s15">If I hesitated, she was taken with that wonderful disorder which was always lying in ambush in her system, ready, at the shortest notice, to prey upon her vitals.</s> <s sid="16" id="DC.c28.s16">If I rang the bell impatiently, after half-a-dozen unavailing modest pulls, and she appeared at last - which was not by any means to be relied upon - she would appear with a reproachful aspect, sink breathless on a chair near the door, lay her hand upon her nankeen bosom, and become so ill, that I was glad, at any sacrifice of brandy or anything else, to get rid of her.</s> <s sid="17" id="DC.c28.s17">If I objected to having my bed made at five o'clock in the afternoon - which I do still think an uncomfortable arrangement - one motion of her hand towards the same nankeen region of wounded sensibility was enough to make me falter an apology.</s> <s sid="18" id="DC.c28.s18">In short, I would have done anything in an honourable way rather than give Mrs. Crupp offence; and she was the terror of my life.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DC.c28.p4"><s sid="19" id="DC.c28.s19">I bought a second-hand dumb-waiter for this dinner-party, in preference to re-engaging the handy young man; against whom I had conceived a prejudice, in consequence of meeting him in the Strand, one Sunday morning, in a waistcoat remarkably like one of mine, which had been missing since the former occasion.</s> <s sid="20" id="DC.c28.s20">The 'young gal' was re-engaged; but on the stipulation that she should only bring in the dishes, and then withdraw to the landing-place, beyond the outer door; where a habit of sniffing she had contracted would be lost upon the guests, and where her retiring on the plates would be a physical impossibility.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="DC.c28.p12"><s sid="39" id="DC.c28.s39">To divert his thoughts from this melancholy subject, I informed Mr. Micawber that I relied upon him for a bowl of punch, and led him to the lemons.</s> <s sid="40" id="DC.c28.s40">His recent despondency, not to say despair, was gone in a moment.</s> <s sid="41" id="DC.c28.s41">I never saw a man so thoroughly enjoy himself amid the fragrance of lemon-peel and sugar, the odour of burning rum, and the steam of boiling water, as Mr. Micawber did that afternoon.</s> <s sid="42" id="DC.c28.s42">It was wonderful to see his face shining at us out of a thin cloud of these delicate fumes, as he stirred, and mixed, and tasted, and looked as if he were making, instead of punch, a fortune for his family down to the latest posterity.</s> <s sid="43" id="DC.c28.s43">As to Mrs. Micawber, I don't know whether it was the effect of the cap, or the lavender-water, or the pins, or the fire, or the wax-candles, but she came out of my room, comparatively speaking, lovely.</s> <s sid="44" id="DC.c28.s44">And the lark was never gayer than that excellent woman.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DC.c31.p1"><s sid="1" id="DC.c31.s1">It was not difficult for me, on Peggotty's solicitation, to resolve to stay where I was, until after the remains of the poor carrier should have made their last journey to Blunderstone.</s> <s sid="2" id="DC.c31.s2">She had long ago bought, out of her own savings, a little piece of ground in our old churchyard near the grave of 'her sweet girl', as she always called my mother; and there they were to rest.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c31.p2"><s sid="3" id="DC.c31.s3">In keeping Peggotty company, and doing all I could for her (little enough at the utmost), I was as grateful, I rejoice to think, as even now I could wish myself to have been.</s> <s sid="4" id="DC.c31.s4">But I am afraid I had a supreme satisfaction, of a personal and professional nature, in taking charge of Mr. Barkis's will, and expounding its contents.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DC.c31.p3"><s sid="5" id="DC.c31.s5">I may claim the merit of having originated the suggestion that the will should be looked for in the box.</s> <s sid="6" id="DC.c31.s6">After some search, it was found in the box, at the bottom of a horse's nose-bag; wherein (besides hay) there was discovered an old gold watch, with chain and seals, which Mr. Barkis had worn on his wedding-day, and which had never been seen before or since; a silver tobacco-stopper, in the form of a leg; an imitation lemon, full of minute cups and saucers, which I have some idea Mr. Barkis must have purchased to present to me when I was a child, and afterwards found himself unable to part with; eighty-seven guineas and a half, in guineas and half-guineas; two hundred and ten pounds, in perfectly clean Bank notes; certain receipts for Bank of England stock; an old horseshoe, a bad shilling, a piece of camphor, and an oyster-shell.</s> <s sid="7" id="DC.c31.s7">From the circumstance of the latter article having been much polished, and displaying prismatic colours on the inside, I conclude that Mr. Barkis had some general ideas about pearls, which never resolved themselves into anything definite.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DC.c31.p4"><s sid="8" id="DC.c31.s8">For years and years, Mr. Barkis had carried this box, on all his journeys, every day.</s> <s sid="9" id="DC.c31.s9">That it might the better escape notice, he had invented a fiction that it belonged to 'Mr. Blackboy', and was 'to be left with Barkis till called for'; a fable he had elaborately written on the lid, in characters now scarcely legible.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DC.c31.p5"><s sid="10" id="DC.c31.s10">He had hoarded, all these years, I found, to good purpose.</s> <s sid="11" id="DC.c31.s11">His property in money amounted to nearly three thousand pounds.</s> <s sid="12" id="DC.c31.s12">Of this he bequeathed the interest of one thousand to Mr. Peggotty for his life; on his decease, the principal to be equally divided between Peggotty, little Emily, and me, or the survivor or survivors of us, share and share alike.</s> <s sid="13" id="DC.c31.s13">All the rest he died possessed of, he bequeathed to Peggotty; whom he left residuary legatee, and sole executrix of that his last will and testament.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="DC.c31.p11"><s sid="31" id="DC.c31.s31">My old nurse was to go to London with me next day, on the business of the will.</s> <s sid="32" id="DC.c31.s32">Little Emily was passing that day at Mr. Omer's.</s> <s sid="33" id="DC.c31.s33">We were all to meet in the old boathouse that night.</s> <s sid="34" id="DC.c31.s34">Ham would bring Emily at the usual hour.</s> <s sid="35" id="DC.c31.s35">I would walk back at my leisure.</s> <s sid="36" id="DC.c31.s36">The brother and sister would return as they had come, and be expecting us, when the day closed in, at the fireside.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="DC.c31.p12"><s sid="37" id="DC.c31.s37">I parted from them at the wicket-gate, where visionary Strap had rested with Roderick Random's knapsack in the days of yore; and, instead of going straight back, walked a little distance on the road to Lowestoft.</s> <s sid="38" id="DC.c31.s38">Then I turned, and walked back towards Yarmouth.</s> <s sid="39" id="DC.c31.s39">I stayed to dine at a decent alehouse, some mile or two from the Ferry I have mentioned before; and thus the day wore away, and it was evening when I reached it.</s> <s sid="40" id="DC.c31.s40">Rain was falling heavily by that time, and it was a wild night; but there was a moon behind the clouds, and it was not dark.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="DC.c33.p1"><s sid="1" id="DC.c33.s1">All this time, I had gone on loving Dora, harder than ever.</s> <s sid="2" id="DC.c33.s2">Her idea was my refuge in disappointment and distress, and made some amends to me, even for the loss of my friend.</s> <s sid="3" id="DC.c33.s3">The more I pitied myself, or pitied others, the more I sought for consolation in the image of Dora.</s> <s sid="4" id="DC.c33.s4">The greater the accumulation of deceit and trouble in the world, the brighter and the purer shone the star of Dora high above the world.</s> <s sid="5" id="DC.c33.s5">I don't think I had any definite idea where Dora came from, or in what degree she was related to a higher order of beings; but I am quite sure I should have scouted the notion of her being simply human, like any other young lady, with indignation and contempt.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c33.p2"><s sid="6" id="DC.c33.s6">If I may so express it, I was steeped in Dora.</s> <s sid="7" id="DC.c33.s7">I was not merely over head and ears in love with her, but I was saturated through and through.</s> <s sid="8" id="DC.c33.s8">Enough love might have been wrung out of me, metaphorically speaking, to drown anybody in; and yet there would have remained enough within me, and all over me, to pervade my entire existence.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DC.c33.p3"><s sid="9" id="DC.c33.s9">The first thing I did, on my own account, when I came back, was to take a night-walk to Norwood, and, like the subject of a venerable riddle of my childhood, to go 'round and round the house, without ever touching the house', thinking about Dora.</s> <s sid="10" id="DC.c33.s10">I believe the theme of this incomprehensible conundrum was the moon.</s> <s sid="11" id="DC.c33.s11">No matter what it was, I, the moon-struck slave of Dora, perambulated round and round the house and garden for two hours, looking through crevices in the palings, getting my chin by dint of violent exertion above the rusty nails on the top, blowing kisses at the lights in the windows, and romantically calling on the night, at intervals, to shield my Dora - I don't exactly know what from, I suppose from fire.</s> <s sid="12" id="DC.c33.s12">Perhaps from mice, to which she had a great objection.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DC.c33.p4" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="DC.c33.s13">My love was so much in my mind and it was so natural to me to confide in Peggotty, when I found her again by my side of an evening with the old set of industrial implements, busily making the tour of my wardrobe, that I imparted to her, in a sufficiently roundabout way, my great secret.</s> <s sid="14" id="DC.c33.s14">Peggotty was strongly interested, but I could not get her into my view of the case at all.</s> <s sid="15" id="DC.c33.s15">She was audaciously prejudiced in my favour, and quite unable to understand why I should have any misgivings, or be low-spirited about it.</s> <s sid="16" id="DC.c33.s16"><qs/>'The young lady might think herself well off,'<qe/><sss/> she observed, <sse/><qs/>'to have such a beau.</s> <s sid="17" id="DC.c33.s17">And as to her Pa,'<qe/><sss/> she said, <sse/><qs/>'what did the gentleman expect, for gracious sake!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="DC.c33.p5"><s sid="18" id="DC.c33.s18">I observed, however, that Mr. Spenlow's proctorial gown and stiff cravat took Peggotty down a little, and inspired her with a greater reverence for the man who was gradually becoming more and more etherealized in my eyes every day, and about whom a reflected radiance seemed to me to beam when he sat erect in Court among his papers, like a little lighthouse in a sea of stationery.</s> <s sid="19" id="DC.c33.s19">And by the by, it used to be uncommonly strange to me to consider, I remember, as I sat in Court too, how those dim old judges and doctors wouldn't have cared for Dora, if they had known her; how they wouldn't have gone out of their senses with rapture, if marriage with Dora had been proposed to them; how Dora might have sung, and played upon that glorified guitar, until she led me to the verge of madness, yet not have tempted one of those slow-goers an inch out of his road!</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DC.c33.p6"><s sid="20" id="DC.c33.s20">I despised them, to a man.</s> <s sid="21" id="DC.c33.s21">Frozen-out old gardeners in the flower-beds of the heart, I took a personal offence against them all.</s> <s sid="22" id="DC.c33.s22">The Bench was nothing to me but an insensible blunderer.</s> <s sid="23" id="DC.c33.s23">The Bar had no more tenderness or poetry in it, than the bar of a public-house.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DC.c33.p7"><s sid="24" id="DC.c33.s24">Taking the management of Peggotty's affairs into my own hands, with no little pride, I proved the will, and came to a settlement with the Legacy Duty-office, and took her to the Bank, and soon got everything into an orderly train.</s> <s sid="25" id="DC.c33.s25">We varied the legal character of these proceedings by going to see some perspiring Wax-work, in Fleet Street (melted, I should hope, these twenty years); and by visiting Miss Linwood's Exhibition, which I remember as a Mausoleum of needlework, favourable to self-examination and repentance; and by inspecting the Tower of London; and going to the top of St.</s> <s sid="26" id="DC.c33.s26">Paul's.</s> <s sid="27" id="DC.c33.s27">All these wonders afforded Peggotty as much pleasure as she was able to enjoy, under existing circumstances: except, I think, St.</s> <s sid="28" id="DC.c33.s28">Paul's, which, from her long attachment to her work-box, became a rival of the picture on the lid, and was, in some particulars, vanquished, she considered, by that work of art.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="DC.c33.p8"><s sid="29" id="DC.c33.s29">Peggotty's business, which was what we used to call 'common-form business' in the Commons (and very light and lucrative the common-form business was), being settled, I took her down to the office one morning to pay her bill.</s> <s sid="30" id="DC.c33.s30">Mr. Spenlow had stepped out, old Tiffey said, to get a gentleman sworn for a marriage licence; but as I knew he would be back directly, our place lying close to the Surrogate's, and to the Vicar-General's office too, I told Peggotty to wait.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="DC.c33.p9"><s sid="31" id="DC.c33.s31">We were a little like undertakers, in the Commons, as regarded Probate transactions; generally making it a rule to look more or less cut up, when we had to deal with clients in mourning.</s> <s sid="32" id="DC.c33.s32">In a similar feeling of delicacy, we were always blithe and light-hearted with the licence clients.</s> <s sid="33" id="DC.c33.s33">Therefore I hinted to Peggotty that she would find Mr. Spenlow much recovered from the shock of Mr. Barkis's decease; and indeed he came in like a bridegroom.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="DC.c33.p10"><s sid="34" id="DC.c33.s34">But neither Peggotty nor I had eyes for him, when we saw, in company with him, Mr. Murdstone.</s> <s sid="35" id="DC.c33.s35">He was very little changed.</s> <s sid="36" id="DC.c33.s36">His hair looked as thick, and was certainly as black, as ever; and his glance was as little to be trusted as of old.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="DC.c33.p11" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="DC.c33.s37"><qs/>'Ah, Copperfield?'<qe/> said Mr. Spenlow.</s> <s sid="38" id="DC.c33.s38"><qs/>'You know this gentleman, I believe?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="12" id="DC.c33.p12"><s sid="39" id="DC.c33.s39">I made my gentleman a distant bow, and Peggotty barely recognized him.</s> <s sid="40" id="DC.c33.s40">He was, at first, somewhat disconcerted to meet us two together; but quickly decided what to do, and came up to me.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="DC.c33.p13" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="DC.c33.s41"><qs/>'I hope,'<qe/><sss/> he said, <sse/><qs/>'that you are doing well?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="DC.c33.p14" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="DC.c33.s42"><qs/>'It can hardly be interesting to you,'<qe/> said I.</s> <s sid="43" id="DC.c33.s43"><qs/>'Yes, if you wish to know.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="DC.c33.p15"><s sid="44" id="DC.c33.s44">We looked at each other, and he addressed himself to Peggotty.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="DC.c33.p16" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="DC.c33.s45"><qs/>'And you,'<qe/> said he.</s> <s sid="46" id="DC.c33.s46"><qs/>'I am sorry to observe that you have lost your husband.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="17" id="DC.c33.p17" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="DC.c33.s47"><qs/>'It's not the first loss I have had in my life, Mr. Murdstone,'<qe/> replied Peggotty, trembling from head to foot.</s> <s sid="48" id="DC.c33.s48"><qs/>'I am glad to hope that there is nobody to blame for this one, - nobody to answer for it.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="18" id="DC.c33.p18" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="DC.c33.s49"><qs/>'Ha!'<qe/><sss/> said he; <sse/><qs/>'that's a comfortable reflection.</s> <s sid="50" id="DC.c33.s50">You have done your duty?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="DC.c33.p19" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="DC.c33.s51"><qs/>'I have not worn anybody's life away,'<qe/><sss/> said Peggotty, <sse/><qs/>'I am thankful to think!</s> <s sid="52" id="DC.c33.s52">No, Mr. Murdstone, I have not worrited and frightened any sweet creetur to an early grave!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="20" id="DC.c33.p20"><s sid="53" id="DC.c33.s53">He eyed her gloomily - remorsefully I thought - for an instant; and said, turning his head towards me, but looking at my feet instead of my face:</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="DC.c33.p21" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="DC.c33.s54"><qs/>'We are not likely to encounter soon again; - a source of satisfaction to us both, no doubt, for such meetings as this can never be agreeable.</s> <s sid="55" id="DC.c33.s55">I do not expect that you, who always rebelled against my just authority, exerted for your benefit and reformation, should owe me any good-will now.</s> <s sid="56" id="DC.c33.s56">There is an antipathy between us -'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="22" id="DC.c33.p22" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="DC.c33.s57"><qs/>'An old one, I believe?'<qe/> said I, interrupting him.</s> </p><p pid="23" id="DC.c33.p23"><s sid="58" id="DC.c33.s58">He smiled, and shot as evil a glance at me as could come from his dark eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="DC.c33.p24" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="DC.c33.s59"><qs/>'It rankled in your baby breast,'<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="60" id="DC.c33.s60"><qs/>'It embittered the life of your poor mother.</s> <s sid="61" id="DC.c33.s61">You are right.</s> <s sid="62" id="DC.c33.s62">I hope you may do better, yet; I hope you may correct yourself.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="DC.c33.p25"><s sid="63" id="DC.c33.s63">Here he ended the dialogue, which had been carried on in a low voice, in a corner of the outer office, by passing into Mr. Spenlow's room, and saying aloud, in his smoothest manner:</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="DC.c33.p26" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="DC.c33.s64"><qs/>'Gentlemen of Mr. Spenlow's profession are accustomed to family differences, and know how complicated and difficult they always are!'<qe/></s> <s sid="65" id="DC.c33.s65">With that, he paid the money for his licence; and, receiving it neatly folded from Mr. Spenlow, together with a shake of the hand, and a polite wish for his happiness and the lady's, went out of the office.</s> </p><p pid="27" id="DC.c33.p27"><s sid="66" id="DC.c33.s66">I might have had more difficulty in constraining myself to be silent under his words, if I had had less difficulty in impressing upon Peggotty (who was only angry on my account, good creature!) that we were not in a place for recrimination, and that I besought her to hold her peace.</s> <s sid="67" id="DC.c33.s67">She was so unusually roused, that I was glad to compound for an affectionate hug, elicited by this revival in her mind of our old injuries, and to make the best I could of it, before Mr. Spenlow and the clerks.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="DC.c33.p28"><s sid="68" id="DC.c33.s68">Mr. Spenlow did not appear to know what the connexion between Mr. Murdstone and myself was; which I was glad of, for I could not bear to acknowledge him, even in my own breast, remembering what I did of the history of my poor mother.</s> <s sid="69" id="DC.c33.s69">Mr. Spenlow seemed to think, if he thought anything about the matter, that my aunt was the leader of the state party in our family, and that there was a rebel party commanded by somebody else - so I gathered at least from what he said, while we were waiting for Mr. Tiffey to make out Peggotty's bill of costs.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="DC.c33.p29" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="DC.c33.s70"><qs/>'Miss Trotwood,'<qe/> he remarked, 'is very firm, no doubt, and not likely to give way to opposition.</s> <s sid="71" id="DC.c33.s71">I have an admiration for her character, and I may congratulate you, Copperfield, on being on the right side.</s> <s sid="72" id="DC.c33.s72">Differences between relations are much to be deplored - but they are extremely general - and the great thing is, to be on the right side': meaning, I take it, on the side of the moneyed interest.</s> </p><p pid="30" id="DC.c33.p30" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="DC.c33.s73"><qs/>'Rather a good marriage this, I believe?'<qe/> said Mr. Spenlow.</s> </p><p pid="31" id="DC.c33.p31"><s sid="74" id="DC.c33.s74">I explained that I knew nothing about it.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="DC.c33.p32" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="DC.c33.s75"><qs/>'Indeed!'<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="76" id="DC.c33.s76"><qs/>'Speaking from the few words Mr. Murdstone dropped - as a man frequently does on these occasions - and from what Miss Murdstone let fall, I should say it was rather a good marriage.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="33" id="DC.c33.p33" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="DC.c33.s77"><qs/>'Do you mean that there is money, sir?'<qe/></s> <s sid="78" id="DC.c33.s78">I asked.</s> </p><p pid="34" id="DC.c33.p34" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="DC.c33.s79"><qs/>'Yes,'<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Spenlow, <sse/><qs/>'I understand there's money.</s> <s sid="80" id="DC.c33.s80">Beauty too, I am told.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="35" id="DC.c33.p35" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="DC.c33.s81"><qs/>'Indeed!</s> <s sid="82" id="DC.c33.s82">Is his new wife young?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="36" id="DC.c33.p36" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="DC.c33.s83"><qs/>'Just of age,'<qe/> said Mr. Spenlow.</s> <s sid="84" id="DC.c33.s84"><qs/>'So lately, that I should think they had been waiting for that.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="37" id="DC.c33.p37" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="DC.c33.s85"><qs/>'Lord deliver her!'<qe/> said Peggotty.</s> <s sid="86" id="DC.c33.s86">So very emphatically and unexpectedly, that we were all three discomposed; until Tiffey came in with the bill.</s> </p><p pid="38" id="DC.c33.p38"><s sid="87" id="DC.c33.s87">Old Tiffey soon appeared, however, and handed it to Mr. Spenlow, to look over.</s> <s sid="88" id="DC.c33.s88">Mr. Spenlow, settling his chin in his cravat and rubbing it softly, went over the items with a deprecatory air - as if it were all Jorkins's doing - and handed it back to Tiffey with a bland sigh.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="DC.c33.p39" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="DC.c33.s89"><qs/>'Yes,'<qe/> he said.</s> <s sid="90" id="DC.c33.s90"><qs/>'That's right.</s> <s sid="91" id="DC.c33.s91">Quite right.</s> <s sid="92" id="DC.c33.s92">I should have been extremely happy, Copperfield, to have limited these charges to the actual expenditure out of pocket, but it is an irksome incident in my professional life, that I am not at liberty to consult my own wishes.</s> <s sid="93" id="DC.c33.s93">I have a partner - Mr. Jorkins.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="40" id="DC.c33.p40"><s sid="94" id="DC.c33.s94">As he said this with a gentle melancholy, which was the next thing to making no charge at all, I expressed my acknowledgements on Peggotty's behalf, and paid Tiffey in banknotes.</s> <s sid="95" id="DC.c33.s95">Peggotty then retired to her lodging, and Mr. Spenlow and I went into Court, where we had a divorce-suit coming on, under an ingenious little statute (repealed now, I believe, but in virtue of which I have seen several marriages annulled), of which the merits were these.</s> <s sid="96" id="DC.c33.s96">The husband, whose name was Thomas Benjamin, had taken out his marriage licence as Thomas only; suppressing the Benjamin, in case he should not find himself as comfortable as he expected.</s> <s sid="97" id="DC.c33.s97">NOT finding himself as comfortable as he expected, or being a little fatigued with his wife, poor fellow, he now came forward, by a friend, after being married a year or two, and declared that his name was Thomas Benjamin, and therefore he was not married at all.</s> <s sid="98" id="DC.c33.s98">Which the Court confirmed, to his great satisfaction.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="DC.c33.p41"><s sid="99" id="DC.c33.s99">I must say that I had my doubts about the strict justice of this, and was not even frightened out of them by the bushel of wheat which reconciles all anomalies.</s> <s sid="100" id="DC.c33.s100">But Mr. Spenlow argued the matter with me.</s> <s sid="101" id="DC.c33.s101">He said, Look at the world, there was good and evil in that; look at the ecclesiastical law, there was good and evil in THAT.</s> <s sid="102" id="DC.c33.s102">It was all part of a system.</s> <s sid="103" id="DC.c33.s103">Very good.</s> <s sid="104" id="DC.c33.s104">There you were!</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="DC.c33.p42"><s sid="105" id="DC.c33.s105">I had not the hardihood to suggest to Dora's father that possibly we might even improve the world a little, if we got up early in the morning, and took off our coats to the work; but I confessed that I thought we might improve the Commons.</s> <s sid="106" id="DC.c33.s106">Mr. Spenlow replied that he would particularly advise me to dismiss that idea from my mind, as not being worthy of my gentlemanly character; but that he would be glad to hear from me of what improvement I thought the Commons susceptible?</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="DC.c33.p43"><s sid="107" id="DC.c33.s107">Taking that part of the Commons which happened to be nearest to us - for our man was unmarried by this time, and we were out of Court, and strolling past the Prerogative Office - I submitted that I thought the Prerogative Office rather a queerly managed institution.</s> <s sid="108" id="DC.c33.s108">Mr. Spenlow inquired in what respect?</s> <s sid="109" id="DC.c33.s109">I replied, with all due deference to his experience (but with more deference, I am afraid, to his being Dora's father), that perhaps it was a little nonsensical that the Registry of that Court, containing the original wills of all persons leaving effects within the immense province of Canterbury, for three whole centuries, should be an accidental building, never designed for the purpose, leased by the registrars for their Own private emolument, unsafe, not even ascertained to be fire-proof, choked with the important documents it held, and positively, from the roof to the basement, a mercenary speculation of the registrars, who took great fees from the public, and crammed the public's wills away anyhow and anywhere, having no other object than to get rid of them cheaply.</s> <s sid="110" id="DC.c33.s110">That, perhaps, it was a little unreasonable that these registrars in the receipt of profits amounting to eight or nine thousand pounds a year (to say nothing of the profits of the deputy registrars, and clerks of seats), should not be obliged to spend a little of that money, in finding a reasonably safe place for the important documents which all classes of people were compelled to hand over to them, whether they would or no.</s> <s sid="111" id="DC.c33.s111">That, perhaps, it was a little unjust, that all the great offices in this great office should be magnificent sinecures, while the unfortunate working-clerks in the cold dark room upstairs were the worst rewarded, and the least considered men, doing important services, in London.</s> <s sid="112" id="DC.c33.s112">That perhaps it was a little indecent that the principal registrar of all, whose duty it was to find the public, constantly resorting to this place, all needful accommodation, should be an enormous sinecurist in virtue of that post (and might be, besides, a clergyman, a pluralist, the holder of a staff in a cathedral, and what not), - while the public was put to the inconvenience of which we had a specimen every afternoon when the office was busy, and which we knew to be quite monstrous.</s> <s sid="113" id="DC.c33.s113">That, perhaps, in short, this Prerogative Office of the diocese of Canterbury was altogether such a pestilent job, and such a pernicious absurdity, that but for its being squeezed away in a corner of St.</s> <s sid="114" id="DC.c33.s114">Paul's Churchyard, which few people knew, it must have been turned completely inside out, and upside down, long ago.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c36.p2"><s sid="9" id="DC.c36.s9">When I found myself on the familiar Highgate road, pursuing such a different errand from that old one of pleasure, with which it was associated, it seemed as if a complete change had come on my whole life.</s> <s sid="10" id="DC.c36.s10">But that did not discourage me.</s> <s sid="11" id="DC.c36.s11">With the new life, came new purpose, new intention.</s> <s sid="12" id="DC.c36.s12">Great was the labour; priceless the reward.</s> <s sid="13" id="DC.c36.s13">Dora was the reward, and Dora must be won.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DC.c36.p4"><s sid="18" id="DC.c36.s18">In this state, I went into a cottage that I saw was to let, and examined it narrowly, - for I felt it necessary to be practical.</s> <s sid="19" id="DC.c36.s19">It would do for me and Dora admirably: with a little front garden for Jip to run about in, and bark at the tradespeople through the railings, and a capital room upstairs for my aunt.</s> <s sid="20" id="DC.c36.s20">I came out again, hotter and faster than ever, and dashed up to Highgate, at such a rate that I was there an hour too early; and, though I had not been, should have been obliged to stroll about to cool myself, before I was at all presentable.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DC.c36.p5"><s sid="21" id="DC.c36.s21">My first care, after putting myself under this necessary course of preparation, was to find the Doctor's house.</s> <s sid="22" id="DC.c36.s22">It was not in that part of Highgate where Mrs. Steerforth lived, but quite on the opposite side of the little town.</s> <s sid="23" id="DC.c36.s23">When I had made this discovery, I went back, in an attraction I could not resist, to a lane by Mrs. Steerforth's, and looked over the corner of the garden wall.</s> <s sid="24" id="DC.c36.s24">His room was shut up close.</s> <s sid="25" id="DC.c36.s25">The conservatory doors were standing open, and Rosa Dartle was walking, bareheaded, with a quick, impetuous step, up and down a gravel walk on one side of the lawn.</s> <s sid="26" id="DC.c36.s26">She gave me the idea of some fierce thing, that was dragging the length of its chain to and fro upon a beaten track, and wearing its heart out.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="DC.c36.p8"><s sid="32" id="DC.c36.s32">Knowing the utter hopelessness of attracting his attention from that distance, I made bold to open the gate, and walk after him, so as to meet him when he should turn round.</s> <s sid="33" id="DC.c36.s33">When he did, and came towards me, he looked at me thoughtfully for a few moments, evidently without thinking about me at all; and then his benevolent face expressed extraordinary pleasure, and he took me by both hands.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 39 WICKFIELD AND HEEP</title>

<p pid="1" id="DC.c39.p1"><s sid="1" id="DC.c39.s1">My aunt, beginning, I imagine, to be made seriously uncomfortable by my prolonged dejection, made a pretence of being anxious that I should go to Dover, to see that all was working well at the cottage, which was let; and to conclude an agreement, with the same tenant, for a longer term of occupation.</s> <s sid="2" id="DC.c39.s2">Janet was drafted into the service of Mrs. Strong, where I saw her every day.</s> <s sid="3" id="DC.c39.s3">She had been undecided, on leaving Dover, whether or no to give the finishing touch to that renunciation of mankind in which she had been educated, by marrying a pilot; but she decided against that venture.</s> <s sid="4" id="DC.c39.s4">Not so much for the sake of principle, I believe, as because she happened not to like him.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="DC.c39.p2"><s sid="5" id="DC.c39.s5">Although it required an effort to leave Miss Mills, I fell rather willingly into my aunt's pretence, as a means of enabling me to pass a few tranquil hours with Agnes.</s> <s sid="6" id="DC.c39.s6">I consulted the good Doctor relative to an absence of three days; and the Doctor wishing me to take that relaxation, - he wished me to take more; but my energy could not bear that, - I made up my mind to go.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="DC.c39.p3"><s sid="7" id="DC.c39.s7">As to the Commons, I had no great occasion to be particular about my duties in that quarter.</s> <s sid="8" id="DC.c39.s8">To say the truth, we were getting in no very good odour among the tip-top proctors, and were rapidly sliding down to but a doubtful position.</s> <s sid="9" id="DC.c39.s9">The business had been indifferent under Mr. jorkins, before Mr. Spenlow's time; and although it had been quickened by the infusion of new blood, and by the display which Mr. Spenlow made, still it was not established on a sufficiently strong basis to bear, without being shaken, such a blow as the sudden loss of its active manager.</s> <s sid="10" id="DC.c39.s10">It fell off very much.</s> <s sid="11" id="DC.c39.s11">Mr. jorkins, notwithstanding his reputation in the firm, was an easy-going, incapable sort of man, whose reputation out of doors was not calculated to back it up.</s> <s sid="12" id="DC.c39.s12">I was turned over to him now, and when I saw him take his snuff and let the business go, I regretted my aunt's thousand pounds more than ever.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="DC.c39.p4"><s sid="13" id="DC.c39.s13">But this was not the worst of it.</s> <s sid="14" id="DC.c39.s14">There were a number of hangers-on and outsiders about the Commons, who, without being proctors themselves, dabbled in common-form business, and got it done by real proctors, who lent their names in consideration of a share in the spoil; - and there were a good many of these too.</s> <s sid="15" id="DC.c39.s15">As our house now wanted business on any terms, we joined this noble band; and threw out lures to the hangers-on and outsiders, to bring their business to us.</s> <s sid="16" id="DC.c39.s16">Marriage licences and small probates were what we all looked for, and what paid us best; and the competition for these ran very high indeed.</s> <s sid="17" id="DC.c39.s17">Kidnappers and inveiglers were planted in all the avenues of entrance to the Commons, with instructions to do their utmost to cut off all persons in mourning, and all gentlemen with anything bashful in their appearance, and entice them to the offices in which their respective employers were interested; which instructions were so well observed, that I myself, before I was known by sight, was twice hustled into the premises of our principal opponent.</s> <s sid="18" id="DC.c39.s18">The conflicting interests of these touting gentlemen being of a nature to irritate their feelings, personal collisions took place; and the Commons was even scandalized by our principal inveigler (who had formerly been in the wine trade, and afterwards in the sworn brokery line) walking about for some days with a black eye.</s> <s sid="19" id="DC.c39.s19">Any one of these scouts used to think nothing of politely assisting an old lady in black out of a vehicle, killing any proctor whom she inquired for, representing his employer as the lawful successor and representative of that proctor, and bearing the old lady off (sometimes greatly affected) to his employer's office.</s> <s sid="20" id="DC.c39.s20">Many captives were brought to me in this way.</s> <s sid="21" id="DC.c39.s21">As to marriage licences, the competition rose to such a pitch, that a shy gentleman in want of one, had nothing to do but submit himself to the first inveigler, or be fought for, and become the prey of the strongest.</s> <s sid="22" id="DC.c39.s22">One of our clerks, who was an outsider, used, in the height of this contest, to sit with his hat on, that he might be ready to rush out and swear before a surrogate any victim who was brought in.</s> <s sid="23" id="DC.c39.s23">The system of inveigling continues, I believe, to this day.</s> <s sid="24" id="DC.c39.s24">The last time I was in the Commons, a civil able-bodied person in a white apron pounced out upon me from a doorway, and whispering the word 'Marriage-licence' in my ear, was with great difficulty prevented from taking me up in his arms and lifting me into a proctor's.</s> <s sid="25" id="DC.c39.s25">From this digression, let me proceed to Dover.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="DC.c39.p5"><s sid="26" id="DC.c39.s26">I found everything in a satisfactory state at the cottage; and was enabled to gratify my aunt exceedingly by reporting that the tenant inherited her feud, and waged incessant war against donkeys.</s> <s sid="27" id="DC.c39.s27">Having settled the little business I had to transact there, and slept there one night, I walked on to Canterbury early in the morning.</s> <s sid="28" id="DC.c39.s28">It was now winter again; and the fresh, cold windy day, and the sweeping downland, brightened up my hopes a little.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="DC.c39.p6"><s sid="29" id="DC.c39.s29">Coming into Canterbury, I loitered through the old streets with a sober pleasure that calmed my spirits, and eased my heart.</s> <s sid="30" id="DC.c39.s30">There were the old signs, the old names over the shops, the old people serving in them.</s> <s sid="31" id="DC.c39.s31">It appeared so long, since I had been a schoolboy there, that I wondered the place was so little changed, until I reflected how little I was changed myself.</s> <s sid="32" id="DC.c39.s32">Strange to say, that quiet influence which was inseparable in my mind from Agnes, seemed to pervade even the city where she dwelt.</s> <s sid="33" id="DC.c39.s33">The venerable cathedral towers, and the old jackdaws and rooks whose airy voices made them more retired than perfect silence would have done; the battered gateways, one stuck full with statues, long thrown down, and crumbled away, like the reverential pilgrims who had gazed upon them; the still nooks, where the ivied growth of centuries crept over gabled ends and ruined walls; the ancient houses, the pastoral landscape of field, orchard, and garden; everywhere - on everything - I felt the same serener air, the same calm, thoughtful, softening spirit.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="DC.c39.p7"><s sid="34" id="DC.c39.s34">Arrived at Mr. Wickfield's house, I found, in the little lower room on the ground floor, where Uriah Heep had been of old accustomed to sit, Mr. Micawber plying his pen with great assiduity.</s> <s sid="35" id="DC.c39.s35">He was dressed in a legal-looking suit of black, and loomed, burly and large, in that small office.</s> </p>
