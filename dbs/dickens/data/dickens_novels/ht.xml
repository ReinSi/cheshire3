<p pid="1" id="HT.c7.p1"><s sid="1" id="HT.c7.s1">MR.</s> <s sid="2" id="HT.c7.s2">BOUNDERBY being a bachelor, an elderly lady presided over his establishment, in consideration of a certain annual stipend.</s> <s sid="3" id="HT.c7.s3">Mrs. Sparsit was this lady's name; and she was a prominent figure in attendance on Mr. Bounderby's car, as it rolled along in triumph with the Bully of humility inside.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="HT.c7.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="HT.c7.s4">For, Mrs. Sparsit had not only seen different days, but was highly connected.</s> <s sid="5" id="HT.c7.s5">She had a great aunt living in these very times called Lady Scadgers.</s> <s sid="6" id="HT.c7.s6">Mr. Sparsit, deceased, of whom she was the relict, had been by the mother's side what Mrs. Sparsit still called <qs/>'a Powler.'<qe/></s> <s sid="7" id="HT.c7.s7">Strangers of limited information and dull apprehension were sometimes observed not to know what a Powler was, and even to appear uncertain whether it might be a business, or a political party, or a profession of faith.</s> <s sid="8" id="HT.c7.s8">The better class of minds, however, did not need to be informed that the Powlers were an ancient stock, who could trace themselves so exceedingly far back that it was not surprising if they sometimes lost themselves - which they had rather frequently done, as respected horse-flesh, blind-hookey, Hebrew monetary transactions, and the Insolvent Debtors' Court.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="HT.c7.p3"><s sid="9" id="HT.c7.s9">The late Mr. Sparsit, being by the mother's side a Powler, married this lady, being by the father's side a Scadgers.</s> <s sid="10" id="HT.c7.s10">Lady Scadgers (an immensely fat old woman, with an inordinate appetite for butcher's meat, and a mysterious leg which had now refused to get out of bed for fourteen years) contrived the marriage, at a period when Sparsit was just of age, and chiefly noticeable for a slender body, weakly supported on two long slim props, and surmounted by no head worth mentioning.</s> <s sid="11" id="HT.c7.s11">He inherited a fair fortune from his uncle, but owed it all before he came into it, and spent it twice over immediately afterwards.</s> <s sid="12" id="HT.c7.s12">Thus, when he died, at twenty-four (the scene of his decease, Calais, and the cause, brandy), he did not leave his widow, from whom he had been separated soon after the honeymoon, in affluent circumstances.</s> <s sid="13" id="HT.c7.s13">That bereaved lady, fifteen years older than he, fell presently at deadly feud with her only relative, Lady Scadgers; and, partly to spite her ladyship, and partly to maintain herself, went out at a salary.</s> <s sid="14" id="HT.c7.s14">And here she was now, in her elderly days, with the Coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows which had captivated Sparsit, making Mr. Bounderby's tea as he took his breakfast.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="HT.c7.p4" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="HT.c7.s15">If Bounderby had been a Conqueror, and Mrs. Sparsit a captive Princess whom he took about as a feature in his state-processions, he could not have made a greater flourish with her than he habitually did.</s> <s sid="16" id="HT.c7.s16">Just as it belonged to his boastfulness to depreciate his own extraction, so it belonged to it to exalt Mrs. Sparsit's.</s> <s sid="17" id="HT.c7.s17">In the measure that he would not allow his own youth to have been attended by a single favourable circumstance, he brightened Mrs. Sparsit's juvenile career with every possible advantage, and showered waggon-loads of early roses all over that lady's path.</s> <s sid="18" id="HT.c7.s18"><qs/>'And yet, sir,'<qe/><sss/> he would say, <sse/><qs/>'how does it turn out after all?</s> <s sid="19" id="HT.c7.s19">Why here she is at a hundred a year (I give her a hundred, which she is pleased to term handsome), keeping the house of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="HT.c7.p5"><s sid="20" id="HT.c7.s20">Nay, he made this foil of his so very widely known, that third parties took it up, and handled it on some occasions with considerable briskness.</s> <s sid="21" id="HT.c7.s21">It was one of the most exasperating attributes of Bounderby, that he not only sang his own praises but stimulated other men to sing them.</s> <s sid="22" id="HT.c7.s22">There was a moral infection of clap-trap in him.</s> <s sid="23" id="HT.c7.s23">Strangers, modest enough elsewhere, started up at dinners in Coketown, and boasted, in quite a rampant way, of Bounderby.</s> <s sid="24" id="HT.c7.s24">They made him out to be the Royal arms, the Union-Jack, Magna Charta, John Bull, Habeas Corpus, the Bill of Rights, An Englishman's house is his castle, Church and State, and God save the Queen, all put together.</s> <s sid="25" id="HT.c7.s25">And as often (and it was very often) as an orator of this kind brought into his peroration,</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="HT.c7.p6" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="HT.c7.s26"><qs/>'Princes and lords may flourish or may fade, A breath can make them, as a breath has made,'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="7" id="HT.c7.p7"><s sid="27" id="HT.c7.s27">- it was, for certain, more or less understood among the company that he had heard of Mrs. Sparsit.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="HT.c10.p31"><s sid="73" id="HT.c10.s73">His home, in such another street as the first, saving that it was narrower, was over a little shop.</s> <s sid="74" id="HT.c10.s74">How it came to pass that any people found it worth their while to sell or buy the wretched little toys, mixed up in its window with cheap newspapers and pork (there was a leg to be raffled for to-morrow-night), matters not here.</s> <s sid="75" id="HT.c10.s75">He took his end of candle from a shelf, lighted it at another end of candle on the counter, without disturbing the mistress of the shop who was asleep in her little room, and went upstairs into his lodging.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="HT.c17.p1"><s sid="1" id="HT.c17.s1">A SUNNY midsummer day.</s> <s sid="2" id="HT.c17.s2">There was such a thing sometimes, even in Coketown.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="HT.c17.p2"><s sid="3" id="HT.c17.s3">Seen from a distance in such weather, Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of its own, which appeared impervious to the sun's rays.</s> <s sid="4" id="HT.c17.s4">You only knew the town was there, because you knew there could have been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town.</s> <s sid="5" id="HT.c17.s5">A blur of soot and smoke, now confusedly tending this way, now that way, now aspiring to the vault of Heaven, now murkily creeping along the earth, as the wind rose and fell, or changed its quarter:  a dense formless jumble, with sheets of cross light in it, that showed nothing but masses of darkness:- Coketown in the distance was suggestive of itself, though not a brick of it could be seen.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="HT.c17.p3" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="HT.c17.s6">The wonder was, it was there at all.</s> <s sid="7" id="HT.c17.s7">It had been ruined so often, that it was amazing how it had borne so many shocks.</s> <s sid="8" id="HT.c17.s8">Surely there never was such fragile china-ware as that of which the millers of Coketown were made.</s> <s sid="9" id="HT.c17.s9">Handle them never so lightly, and they fell to pieces with such ease that you might suspect them of having been flawed before.</s> <s sid="10" id="HT.c17.s10">They were ruined, when they were required to send labouring children to school; they were ruined when inspectors were appointed to look into their works; they were ruined, when such inspectors considered it doubtful whether they were quite justified in chopping people up with their machinery; they were utterly undone, when it was hinted that perhaps they need not always make quite so much smoke.</s> <s sid="11" id="HT.c17.s11">Besides Mr. Bounderby's gold spoon which was generally received in Coketown, another prevalent fiction was very popular there.</s> <s sid="12" id="HT.c17.s12">It took the form of a threat.</s> <s sid="13" id="HT.c17.s13">Whenever a Coketowner felt he was ill-used - that is to say, whenever he was not left entirely alone, and it was proposed to hold him accountable for the consequences of any of his acts - he was sure to come out with the awful menace, that he would <qs/>'sooner pitch his property into the Atlantic.'<qe/></s> <s sid="14" id="HT.c17.s14">This had terrified the Home Secretary within an inch of his life, on several occasions.</s> </p><p pid="4" id="HT.c17.p4"><s sid="15" id="HT.c17.s15">However, the Coketowners were so patriotic after all, that they never had pitched their property into the Atlantic yet, but, on the contrary, had been kind enough to take mighty good care of it.</s> <s sid="16" id="HT.c17.s16">So there it was, in the haze yonder; and it increased and multiplied.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="HT.c17.p5"><s sid="17" id="HT.c17.s17">The streets were hot and dusty on the summer day, and the sun was so bright that it even shone through the heavy vapour drooping over Coketown, and could not be looked at steadily.</s> <s sid="18" id="HT.c17.s18">Stokers emerged from low underground doorways into factory yards, and sat on steps, and posts, and palings, wiping their swarthy visages, and contemplating coals.</s> <s sid="19" id="HT.c17.s19">The whole town seemed to be frying in oil.</s> <s sid="20" id="HT.c17.s20">There was a stifling smell of hot oil everywhere.</s> <s sid="21" id="HT.c17.s21">The steam- engines shone with it, the dresses of the Hands were soiled with it, the mills throughout their many stories oozed and trickled it.</s> <s sid="22" id="HT.c17.s22">The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the breath of the simoom:  and their inhabitants, wasting with heat, toiled languidly in the desert.</s> <s sid="23" id="HT.c17.s23">But no temperature made the melancholy mad elephants more mad or more sane.</s> <s sid="24" id="HT.c17.s24">Their wearisome heads went up and down at the same rate, in hot weather and cold, wet weather and dry, fair weather and foul.</s> <s sid="25" id="HT.c17.s25">The measured motion of their shadows on the walls, was the substitute Coketown had to show for the shadows of rustling woods; while, for the summer hum of insects, it could offer, all the year round, from the dawn of Monday to the night of Saturday, the whirr of shafts and wheels.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="HT.c17.p6"><s sid="26" id="HT.c17.s26">Drowsily they whirred all through this sunny day, making the passenger more sleepy and more hot as he passed the humming walls of the mills.</s> <s sid="27" id="HT.c17.s27">Sun-blinds, and sprinklings of water, a little cooled the main streets and the shops; but the mills, and the courts and alleys, baked at a fierce heat.</s> <s sid="28" id="HT.c17.s28">Down upon the river that was black and thick with dye, some Coketown boys who were at large - a rare sight there - rowed a crazy boat, which made a spumous track upon the water as it jogged along, while every dip of an oar stirred up vile smells.</s> <s sid="29" id="HT.c17.s29">But the sun itself, however beneficent, generally, was less kind to Coketown than hard frost, and rarely looked intently into any of its closer regions without engendering more death than life.</s> <s sid="30" id="HT.c17.s30">So does the eye of Heaven itself become an evil eye, when incapable or sordid hands are interposed between it and the things it looks upon to bless.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="HT.c17.p7"><s sid="31" id="HT.c17.s31">Mrs. Sparsit sat in her afternoon apartment at the Bank, on the shadier side of the frying street.</s> <s sid="32" id="HT.c17.s32">Office-hours were over:  and at that period of the day, in warm weather, she usually embellished with her genteel presence, a managerial board-room over the public office.</s> <s sid="33" id="HT.c17.s33">Her own private sitting-room was a story higher, at the window of which post of observation she was ready, every morning, to greet Mr. Bounderby, as he came across the road, with the sympathizing recognition appropriate to a Victim.</s> <s sid="34" id="HT.c17.s34">He had been married now a year; and Mrs. Sparsit had never released him from her determined pity a moment.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="HT.c17.p8"><s sid="35" id="HT.c17.s35">The Bank offered no violence to the wholesome monotony of the town.</s> <s sid="36" id="HT.c17.s36">It was another red brick house, with black outside shutters, green inside blinds, a black street-door up two white steps, a brazen door-plate, and a brazen door-handle full stop.</s> <s sid="37" id="HT.c17.s37">It was a size larger than Mr. Bounderby's house, as other houses were from a size to half-a-dozen sizes smaller; in all other particulars, it was strictly according to pattern.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="HT.c26.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="HT.c26.s4">Mr. Bounderby, having got it into his explosive composition that Mrs. Sparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he had that general cross upon him in his deserts (for he had not yet settled what it was), and further that Louisa would have objected to her as a frequent visitor if it had comported with his greatness that she should object to anything he chose to do, resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily.</s> <s sid="5" id="HT.c26.s5">So when her nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming sweetbreads in solitude, he said to her at the dinner-table, on the day before her departure, <qs/>'I tell you what, ma'am; you shall come down here of a Saturday, while the fine weather lasts, and stay till Monday.'<qe/></s> <s sid="6" id="HT.c26.s6">To which Mrs. Sparsit returned, in effect, though not of the Mahomedan persuasion:</s> <s sid="7" id="HT.c26.s7"><qs/>'To hear is to obey.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="3" id="HT.c26.p3"><s sid="8" id="HT.c26.s8">Now, Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she took an idea in the nature of an allegorical fancy, into her head.</s> <s sid="9" id="HT.c26.s9">Much watching of Louisa, and much consequent observation of her impenetrable demeanour, which keenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit's edge, must have given her as it were a lift, in the way of inspiration.</s> <s sid="10" id="HT.c26.s10">She erected in her mind a mighty Staircase, with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and down those stairs, from day to day and hour to hour, she saw Louisa coming.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="HT.c26.p4"><s sid="11" id="HT.c26.s11">It became the business of Mrs. Sparsit's life, to look up at her staircase, and to watch Louisa coming down.</s> <s sid="12" id="HT.c26.s12">Sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly, sometimes several steps at one bout, sometimes stopping, never turning back.</s> <s sid="13" id="HT.c26.s13">If she had once turned back, it might have been the death of Mrs. Sparsit in spleen and grief.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="HT.c26.p5"><s sid="14" id="HT.c26.s14">She had been descending steadily, to the day, and on the day, when Mr. Bounderby issued the weekly invitation recorded above.</s> <s sid="15" id="HT.c26.s15">Mrs. Sparsit was in good spirits, and inclined to be conversational.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="HT.c26.p17" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="HT.c26.s42">She sat by Mr. Harthouse, in an alcove in the garden, talking very low; he stood leaning over her, as they whispered together, and his face almost touched her hair.</s> <s sid="43" id="HT.c26.s43"><qs/>'If not quite!'<qe/> said Mrs. Sparsit, straining her hawk's eyes to the utmost.</s> <s sid="44" id="HT.c26.s44">Mrs. Sparsit was too distant to hear a word of their discourse, or even to know that they were speaking softly, otherwise than from the expression of their figures; but what they said was this:</s> </p><p pid="18" id="HT.c26.p18" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="HT.c26.s45"><qs/>'You recollect the man, Mr. Harthouse?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="HT.c26.p19" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="HT.c26.s46"><qs/>'Oh, perfectly!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="20" id="HT.c26.p20" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="HT.c26.s47"><qs/>'His face, and his manner, and what he said?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="21" id="HT.c26.p21" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="HT.c26.s48"><qs/>'Perfectly.</s> <s sid="49" id="HT.c26.s49">And an infinitely dreary person he appeared to me to be.</s> <s sid="50" id="HT.c26.s50">Lengthy and prosy in the extreme.</s> <s sid="51" id="HT.c26.s51">It was knowing to hold forth, in the humble-virtue school of eloquence; but, I assure you I thought at the time, "My good fellow, you are over-doing this!"'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="22" id="HT.c26.p22" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="HT.c26.s52"><qs/>'It has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="HT.c26.p23" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="HT.c26.s53"><qs/>'My dear Louisa - as Tom says.'<qe/></s> <s sid="54" id="HT.c26.s54">Which he never did say.</s> <s sid="55" id="HT.c26.s55"><qs/>'You know no good of the fellow?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="24" id="HT.c26.p24" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="HT.c26.s56"><qs/>'No, certainly.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="HT.c26.p25" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="HT.c26.s57"><qs/>'Nor of any other such person?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="26" id="HT.c26.p26" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="HT.c26.s58"><qs/>'How can I,'<qe/><sls/> she returned, with more of her first manner on her than he had lately seen, <sle/><qs/>'when I know nothing of them, men or women?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="27" id="HT.c26.p27" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="HT.c26.s59"><qs/>'My dear Louisa, then consent to receive the submissive representation of your devoted friend, who knows something of several varieties of his excellent fellow-creatures - for excellent they are, I am quite ready to believe, in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to what they can get hold of.</s> <s sid="60" id="HT.c26.s60">This fellow talks.</s> <s sid="61" id="HT.c26.s61">Well; every fellow talks.</s> <s sid="62" id="HT.c26.s62">He professes morality.</s> <s sid="63" id="HT.c26.s63">Well; all sorts of humbugs profess morality.</s> <s sid="64" id="HT.c26.s64">From the House of Commons to the House of Correction, there is a general profession of morality, except among our people; it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving.</s> <s sid="65" id="HT.c26.s65">You saw and heard the case.</s> <s sid="66" id="HT.c26.s66">Here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed friend Mr. Bounderby - who, as we know, is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so tight a hand.</s> <s sid="67" id="HT.c26.s67">The member of the fluffy classes was injured, exasperated, left the house grumbling, met somebody who proposed to him to go in for some share in this Bank business, went in, put something in his pocket which had nothing in it before, and relieved his mind extremely.</s> <s sid="68" id="HT.c26.s68">Really he would have been an uncommon, instead of a common, fellow, if he had not availed himself of such an opportunity.</s> <s sid="69" id="HT.c26.s69">Or he may have originated it altogether, if he had the cleverness.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="28" id="HT.c26.p28" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="HT.c26.s70"><qs/>'I almost feel as though it must be bad in me,'<qe/><sls/> returned Louisa, after sitting thoughtful awhile, <sle/><qs/>'to be so ready to agree with you, and to be so lightened in my heart by what you say.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="29" id="HT.c26.p29" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="HT.c26.s71"><qs/>'I only say what is reasonable; nothing worse.</s> <s sid="72" id="HT.c26.s72">I have talked it over with my friend Tom more than once - of course I remain on terms of perfect confidence with Tom - and he is quite of my opinion, and I am quite of his.</s> <s sid="73" id="HT.c26.s73">Will you walk?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="30" id="HT.c26.p30"><s sid="74" id="HT.c26.s74">They strolled away, among the lanes beginning to be indistinct in the twilight - she leaning on his arm - and she little thought how she was going down, down, down, Mrs. Sparsit's staircase.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="HT.c26.p31"><s sid="75" id="HT.c26.s75">Night and day, Mrs. Sparsit kept it standing.</s> <s sid="76" id="HT.c26.s76">When Louisa had arrived at the bottom and disappeared in the gulf, it might fall in upon her if it would; but, until then, there it was to be, a Building, before Mrs. Sparsit's eyes.</s> <s sid="77" id="HT.c26.s77">And there Louisa always was, upon it.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="HT.c26.p32"><s sid="78" id="HT.c26.s78">And always gliding down, down, down!</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="HT.c26.p33"><s sid="79" id="HT.c26.s79">Mrs. Sparsit saw James Harthouse come and go; she heard of him here and there; she saw the changes of the face he had studied; she, too, remarked to a nicety how and when it clouded, how and when it cleared; she kept her black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with no touch of compunction, all absorbed in interest.</s> <s sid="80" id="HT.c26.s80">In the interest of seeing her, ever drawing, with no hand to stay her, nearer and nearer to the bottom of this new Giant's Staircase.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="HT.c26.p34"><s sid="81" id="HT.c26.s81">With all her deference for Mr. Bounderby as contradistinguished from his portrait, Mrs. Sparsit had not the smallest intention of interrupting the descent.</s> <s sid="82" id="HT.c26.s82">Eager to see it accomplished, and yet patient, she waited for the last fall, as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her hopes.</s> <s sid="83" id="HT.c26.s83">Hushed in expectancy, she kept her wary gaze upon the stairs; and seldom so much as darkly shook her right mitten (with her fist in it), at the figure coming down.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="HT.c27.p1"><s sid="1" id="HT.c27.s1">THE figure descended the great stairs, steadily, steadily; always verging, like a weight in deep water, to the black gulf at the bottom.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="HT.c27.p2"><s sid="2" id="HT.c27.s2">Mr. Gradgrind, apprised of his wife's decease, made an expedition from London, and buried her in a business-like manner.</s> <s sid="3" id="HT.c27.s3">He then returned with promptitude to the national cinder-heap, and resumed his sifting for the odds and ends he wanted, and his throwing of the dust about into the eyes of other people who wanted other odds and ends - in fact resumed his parliamentary duties.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="HT.c27.p3" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="HT.c27.s4">In the meantime, Mrs. Sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward.</s> <s sid="5" id="HT.c27.s5">Separated from her staircase, all the week, by the length of iron road dividing Coketown from the country house, she yet maintained her cat-like observation of Louisa, through her husband, through her brother, through James Harthouse, through the outsides of letters and packets, through everything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs.</s> <s sid="6" id="HT.c27.s6"><qs/>'Your foot on the last step, my lady,'<qe/><sls/> said Mrs. Sparsit, apostrophizing the descending figure, with the aid of her threatening mitten, <sle/><qs/>'and all your art shall never blind me.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="4" id="HT.c27.p4"><s sid="7" id="HT.c27.s7">Art or nature though, the original stock of Louisa's character or the graft of circumstances upon it, - her curious reserve did baffle, while it stimulated, one as sagacious as Mrs. Sparsit.</s> <s sid="8" id="HT.c27.s8">There were times when Mr. James Harthouse was not sure of her.</s> <s sid="9" id="HT.c27.s9">There were times when he could not read the face he had studied so long; and when this lonely girl was a greater mystery to him, than any woman of the world with a ring of satellites to help her.</s> </p>
