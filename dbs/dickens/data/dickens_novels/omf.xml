<title>Chapter 1 ON THE LOOK OUT</title>

<p pid="1" id="OMF.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="OMF.c1.s1">In these times of ours, though concerning the exact year there is no need to be precise, a boat of dirty and disreputable appearance, with two figures in it, floated on the Thames, between Southwark bridge which is of iron, and London Bridge which is of stone, as an autumn evening was closing in.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OMF.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="OMF.c1.s2">The figures in this boat were those of a strong man with ragged grizzled hair and a sun-browned face, and a dark girl of nineteen or twenty, sufficiently like him to be recognizable as his daughter.</s> <s sid="3" id="OMF.c1.s3">The girl rowed, pulling a pair of sculls very easily; the man, with the rudder-lines slack in his hands, and his hands loose in his waistband, kept an eager look out.</s> <s sid="4" id="OMF.c1.s4">He had no net, hook, or line, and he could not be a fisherman; his boat had no cushion for a sitter, no paint, no inscription, no appliance beyond a rusty boathook and a coil of rope, and he could not be a waterman; his boat was too crazy and too small to take in cargo for delivery, and he could not be a lighterman or river-carrier; there was no clue to what he looked for, but he looked for something, with a most intent and searching gaze.</s> <s sid="5" id="OMF.c1.s5">The tide, which had turned an hour before, was running down, and his eyes watched every little race and eddy in its broad sweep, as the boat made slight head-way against it, or drove stern foremost before it, according as he directed his daughter by a movement of his head.</s> <s sid="6" id="OMF.c1.s6">She watched his face as earnestly as he watched the river.</s> <s sid="7" id="OMF.c1.s7">But, in the intensity of her look there was a touch of dread or horror.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OMF.c1.p3"><s sid="8" id="OMF.c1.s8">Allied to the bottom of the river rather than the surface, by reason of the slime and ooze with which it was covered, and its sodden state, this boat and the two figures in it obviously were doing something that they often did, and were seeking what they often sought.</s> <s sid="9" id="OMF.c1.s9">Half savage as the man showed, with no covering on his matted head, with his brown arms bare to between the elbow and the shoulder, with the loose knot of a looser kerchief lying low on his bare breast in a wilderness of beard and whisker, with such dress as he wore seeming to be made out of the mud that begrimed his boat, still there was a business-like usage in his steady gaze.</s> <s sid="10" id="OMF.c1.s10">So with every lithe action of the girl, with every turn of her wrist, perhaps most of all with her look of dread or horror; they were things of usage.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OMF.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="OMF.c1.s11"><qs/>'Keep her out, Lizzie.</s> <s sid="12" id="OMF.c1.s12">Tide runs strong here.</s> <s sid="13" id="OMF.c1.s13">Keep her well afore the sweep of it.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="OMF.c1.p5"><s sid="14" id="OMF.c1.s14">Trusting to the girl's skill and making no use of the rudder, he eyed the coming tide with an absorbed attention.</s> <s sid="15" id="OMF.c1.s15">So the girl eyed him.</s> <s sid="16" id="OMF.c1.s16">But, it happened now, that a slant of light from the setting sun glanced into the bottom of the boat, and, touching a rotten stain there which bore some resemblance to the outline of a muffled human form, coloured it as though with diluted blood.</s> <s sid="17" id="OMF.c1.s17">This caught the girl's eye, and she shivered.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="OMF.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="OMF.c1.s18"><qs/>'What ails you?'<qe/><sls/> said the man, immediately aware of it, though so intent on the advancing waters; <sle/><qs/>'I see nothing afloat.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="7" id="OMF.c1.p7"><s sid="19" id="OMF.c1.s19">The red light was gone, the shudder was gone, and his gaze, which had come back to the boat for a moment, travelled away again.</s> <s sid="20" id="OMF.c1.s20">Wheresoever the strong tide met with an impediment, his gaze paused for an instant.</s> <s sid="21" id="OMF.c1.s21">At every mooring-chain and rope, at every stationery boat or barge that split the current into a broad- arrowhead, at the offsets from the piers of Southwark Bridge, at the paddles of the river steamboats as they beat the filthy water, at the floating logs of timber lashed together lying off certain wharves, his shining eyes darted a hungry look.</s> <s sid="22" id="OMF.c1.s22">After a darkening hour or so, suddenly the rudder-lines tightened in his hold, and he steered hard towards the Surrey shore.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="OMF.c1.p8"><s sid="23" id="OMF.c1.s23">Always watching his face, the girl instantly answered to the action in her sculling; presently the boat swung round, quivered as from a sudden jerk, and the upper half of the man was stretched out over the stern.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="OMF.c1.p9"><s sid="24" id="OMF.c1.s24">The girl pulled the hood of a cloak she wore, over her head and over her face, and, looking backward so that the front folds of this hood were turned down the river, kept the boat in that direction going before the tide.</s> <s sid="25" id="OMF.c1.s25">Until now, the boat had barely held her own, and had hovered about one spot; but now, the banks changed swiftly, and the deepening shadows and the kindling lights of London Bridge were passed, and the tiers of shipping lay on either hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="OMF.c1.p10" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="OMF.c1.s26">It was not until now that the upper half of the man came back into the boat.</s> <s sid="27" id="OMF.c1.s27">His arms were wet and dirty, and he washed them over the side.</s> <s sid="28" id="OMF.c1.s28">In his right hand he held something, and he washed that in the river too.</s> <s sid="29" id="OMF.c1.s29">It was money.</s> <s sid="30" id="OMF.c1.s30">He chinked it once, and he blew upon it once, and he spat upon it once,--<qs/>'for luck,'<qe/> he hoarsely said --before he put it in his pocket.</s> </p><p pid="11" id="OMF.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="OMF.c1.s31"><qs/>'Lizzie!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="12" id="OMF.c1.p12"><s sid="32" id="OMF.c1.s32">The girl turned her face towards him with a start, and rowed in silence.</s> <s sid="33" id="OMF.c1.s33">Her face was very pale.</s> <s sid="34" id="OMF.c1.s34">He was a hook-nosed man, and with that and his bright eyes and his ruffled head, bore a certain likeness to a roused bird of prey.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="OMF.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="OMF.c1.s35"><qs/>'Take that thing off your face.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="OMF.c1.p14"><s sid="36" id="OMF.c1.s36">She put it back.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="OMF.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="OMF.c1.s37"><qs/>'Here! and give me hold of the sculls.</s> <s sid="38" id="OMF.c1.s38">I'll take the rest of the spell.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="16" id="OMF.c1.p16" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="OMF.c1.s39"><qs/>'No, no, father!</s> <s sid="40" id="OMF.c1.s40">No!</s> <s sid="41" id="OMF.c1.s41">I can't indeed.</s> <s sid="42" id="OMF.c1.s42">Father!--I cannot sit so near it!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="17" id="OMF.c1.p17"><s sid="43" id="OMF.c1.s43">He was moving towards her to change places, but her terrified expostulation stopped him and he resumed his seat.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="OMF.c1.p18" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="OMF.c1.s44"><qs/>'What hurt can it do you?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="OMF.c1.p19" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="OMF.c1.s45"><qs/>'None, none.</s> <s sid="46" id="OMF.c1.s46">But I cannot bear it.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="20" id="OMF.c1.p20" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="OMF.c1.s47"><qs/>'It's my belief you hate the sight of the very river.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="21" id="OMF.c1.p21" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="OMF.c1.s48"><qs/>'I--I do not like it, father.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="22" id="OMF.c1.p22" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="OMF.c1.s49"><qs/>'As if it wasn't your living!</s> <s sid="50" id="OMF.c1.s50">As if it wasn't meat and drink to you!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="OMF.c1.p23"><s sid="51" id="OMF.c1.s51">At these latter words the girl shivered again, and for a moment paused in her rowing, seeming to turn deadly faint.</s> <s sid="52" id="OMF.c1.s52">It escaped his attention, for he was glancing over the stern at something the boat had in tow.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="OMF.c1.p24" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="OMF.c1.s53"><qs/>'How can you be so thankless to your best friend, Lizzie?</s> <s sid="54" id="OMF.c1.s54">The very fire that warmed you when you were a babby, was picked out of the river alongside the coal barges.</s> <s sid="55" id="OMF.c1.s55">The very basket that you slept in, the tide washed ashore.</s> <s sid="56" id="OMF.c1.s56">The very rockers that I put it upon to make a cradle of it, I cut out of a piece of wood that drifted from some ship or another.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="OMF.c1.p25"><s sid="57" id="OMF.c1.s57">Lizzie took her right hand from the scull it held, and touched her lips with it, and for a moment held it out lovingly towards him: then, without speaking, she resumed her rowing, as another boat of similar appearance, though in rather better trim, came out from a dark place and dropped softly alongside.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="OMF.c1.p26" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="OMF.c1.s58"><qs/>'In luck again, Gaffer?'<qe/><sls/> said a man with a squinting leer, who sculled her and who was alone, <sle/><qs/>'I know'd you was in luck again, by your wake as you come down.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="27" id="OMF.c1.p27" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="OMF.c1.s59"><qs/>'Ah!'<qe/> replied the other, drily.</s> <s sid="60" id="OMF.c1.s60"><qs/>'So you're out, are you?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="28" id="OMF.c1.p28" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="OMF.c1.s61"><qs/>'Yes, pardner.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="29" id="OMF.c1.p29"><s sid="62" id="OMF.c1.s62">There was now a tender yellow moonlight on the river, and the new comer, keeping half his boat's length astern of the other boat looked hard at its track.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="OMF.c1.p30" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="OMF.c1.s63"><qs/>'I says to myself,'<qe/><sss/> he went on, <sse/><qs/>'directly you hove in view, yonder's Gaffer, and in luck again, by George if he ain't!</s> <s sid="64" id="OMF.c1.s64">Scull it is, pardner--don't fret yourself--I didn't touch him.'<qe/></s> <s sid="65" id="OMF.c1.s65">This was in answer to a quick impatient movement on the part of Gaffer: the speaker at the same time unshipping his scull on that side, and laying his hand on the gunwale of Gaffer's boat and holding to it.</s> </p><p pid="31" id="OMF.c1.p31" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="OMF.c1.s66"><qs/>'He's had touches enough not to want no more, as well as I make him out, Gaffer!</s> <s sid="67" id="OMF.c1.s67">Been a knocking about with a pretty many tides, ain't he pardner?</s> <s sid="68" id="OMF.c1.s68">Such is my out-of-luck ways, you see!</s> <s sid="69" id="OMF.c1.s69">He must have passed me when he went up last time, for I was on the lookout below bridge here.</s> <s sid="70" id="OMF.c1.s70">I a'most think you're like the wulturs, pardner, and scent 'em out.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="32" id="OMF.c1.p32"><s sid="71" id="OMF.c1.s71">He spoke in a dropped voice, and with more than one glance at Lizzie who had pulled on her hood again.</s> <s sid="72" id="OMF.c1.s72">Both men then looked with a weird unholy interest in the wake of Gaffer's boat.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="OMF.c1.p33" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="OMF.c1.s73"><qs/>'Easy does it, betwixt us.</s> <s sid="74" id="OMF.c1.s74">Shall I take him aboard, pardner?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="34" id="OMF.c1.p34" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="OMF.c1.s75"><qs/>'No,'<qe/> said the other.</s> <s sid="76" id="OMF.c1.s76">In so surly a tone that the man, after a blank stare, acknowledged it with the retort:</s> </p><p pid="35" id="OMF.c1.p35" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="OMF.c1.s77"><qs/>'--Arn't been eating nothing as has disagreed with you, have you, pardner?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="36" id="OMF.c1.p36" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="OMF.c1.s78"><qs/>'Why, yes, I have,'<qe/> said Gaffer.</s> <s sid="79" id="OMF.c1.s79"><qs/>'I have been swallowing too much of that word, Pardner.</s> <s sid="80" id="OMF.c1.s80">I am no pardner of yours.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="37" id="OMF.c1.p37" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="OMF.c1.s81"><qs/>'Since when was you no pardner of mine, Gaffer Hexam Esquire?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="38" id="OMF.c1.p38" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="OMF.c1.s82"><qs/>'Since you was accused of robbing a man.</s> <s sid="83" id="OMF.c1.s83">Accused of robbing a live man!'<qe/> said Gaffer, with great indignation.</s> </p><p pid="39" id="OMF.c1.p39" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="OMF.c1.s84"><qs/>'And what if I had been accused of robbing a dead man, Gaffer?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="40" id="OMF.c1.p40" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="OMF.c1.s85"><qs/>'You COULDN'T do it.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="41" id="OMF.c1.p41" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="OMF.c1.s86"><qs/>'Couldn't you, Gaffer?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="42" id="OMF.c1.p42" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="OMF.c1.s87"><qs/>'No.  Has a dead man any use for money?</s> <s sid="88" id="OMF.c1.s88">Is it possible for a dead man to have money?</s> <s sid="89" id="OMF.c1.s89">What world does a dead man belong to?</s> <s sid="90" id="OMF.c1.s90">'Tother world.</s> <s sid="91" id="OMF.c1.s91">What world does money belong to?</s> <s sid="92" id="OMF.c1.s92">This world.</s> <s sid="93" id="OMF.c1.s93">How can money be a corpse's?</s> <s sid="94" id="OMF.c1.s94">Can a corpse own it, want it, spend it, claim it, miss it?</s> <s sid="95" id="OMF.c1.s95">Don't try to go confounding the rights and wrongs of things in that way.</s> <s sid="96" id="OMF.c1.s96">But it's worthy of the sneaking spirit that robs a live man.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="43" id="OMF.c1.p43" type="speech"><s sid="97" id="OMF.c1.s97"><qs/>'I'll tell you what it is--.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="44" id="OMF.c1.p44" type="speech"><s sid="98" id="OMF.c1.s98"><qs/>'No you won't.</s> <s sid="99" id="OMF.c1.s99">I'll tell you what it is.</s> <s sid="100" id="OMF.c1.s100">You got off with a short time of it for putting you're hand in the pocket of a sailor, a live sailor.</s> <s sid="101" id="OMF.c1.s101">Make the most of it and think yourself lucky, but don't think after that to come over ME with your pardners.</s> <s sid="102" id="OMF.c1.s102">We have worked together in time past, but we work together no more in time present nor yet future.</s> <s sid="103" id="OMF.c1.s103">Let go.</s> <s sid="104" id="OMF.c1.s104">Cast off!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="45" id="OMF.c1.p45" type="speech"><s sid="105" id="OMF.c1.s105"><qs/>'Gaffer!</s> <s sid="106" id="OMF.c1.s106">If you think to get rid of me this way--.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="46" id="OMF.c1.p46" type="speech"><s sid="107" id="OMF.c1.s107"><qs/>'If I don't get rid of you this way, I'll try another, and chop you over the fingers with the stretcher, or take a pick at your head with the boat-hook.</s> <s sid="108" id="OMF.c1.s108">Cast off!</s> <s sid="109" id="OMF.c1.s109">Pull you, Lizzie.</s> <s sid="110" id="OMF.c1.s110">Pull home, since you won't let your father pull.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="47" id="OMF.c1.p47"><s sid="111" id="OMF.c1.s111">Lizzie shot ahead, and the other boat fell astern.</s> <s sid="112" id="OMF.c1.s112">Lizzie's father, composing himself into the easy attitude of one who had asserted the high moralities and taken an unassailable position, slowly lighted a pipe, and smoked, and took a survey of what he had in tow.</s> <s sid="113" id="OMF.c1.s113">What he had in tow, lunged itself at him sometimes in an awful manner when the boat was checked, and sometimes seemed to try to wrench itself away, though for the most part it followed submissively.</s> <s sid="114" id="OMF.c1.s114">A neophyte might have fancied that the ripples passing over it were dreadfully like faint changes of expression on a sightless face; but Gaffer was no neophyte and had no fancies.</s> </p></div>

<title>Chapter 2 THE MAN FROM SOMEWHERE</title>

<p pid="1" id="OMF.c2.p1"><s sid="1" id="OMF.c2.s1">Mr and Mrs Veneering were bran-new people in a bran-new house in a bran-new quarter of London.</s> <s sid="2" id="OMF.c2.s2">Everything about the Veneerings was spick and span new.</s> <s sid="3" id="OMF.c2.s3">All their furniture was new, all their friends were new, all their servants were new, their plate was new, their carriage was new, their harness was new, their horses were new, their pictures were new, they themselves were new, they were as newly married as was lawfully compatible with their having a bran-new baby, and if they had set up a great-grandfather, he would have come home in matting from the Pantechnicon, without a scratch upon him, French polished to the crown of his head.</s> </p>

<title>Chapter 4 THE R. WILFER FAMILY</title>

<p pid="1" id="OMF.c4.p1"><s sid="1" id="OMF.c4.s1">Reginald Wilfer is a name with rather a grand sound, suggesting on first acquaintance brasses in country churches, scrolls in stained-glass windows, and generally the De Wilfers who came over with the Conqueror.</s> <s sid="2" id="OMF.c4.s2">For, it is a remarkable fact in genealogy that no De Any ones ever came over with Anybody else.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OMF.c4.p2"><s sid="3" id="OMF.c4.s3">But, the Reginald Wilfer family were of such commonplace extraction and pursuits that their forefathers had for generations modestly subsisted on the Docks, the Excise Office, and the Custom House, and the existing R. Wilfer was a poor clerk.</s> <s sid="4" id="OMF.c4.s4">So poor a clerk, though having a limited salary and an unlimited family, that he had never yet attained the modest object of his ambition: which was, to wear a complete new suit of clothes, hat and boots included, at one time.</s> <s sid="5" id="OMF.c4.s5">His black hat was brown before he could afford a coat, his pantaloons were white at the seams and knees before he could buy a pair of boots, his boots had worn out before he could treat himself to new pantaloons, and, by the time he worked round to the hat again, that shining modern article roofed-in an ancient ruin of various periods.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="OMF.c6.p1"><s sid="1" id="OMF.c6.s1">The Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, already mentioned as a tavern of a dropsical appearance, had long settled down into a state of hale infirmity.</s> <s sid="2" id="OMF.c6.s2">In its whole constitution it had not a straight floor, and hardly a straight line; but it had outlasted, and clearly would yet outlast, many a better-trimmed building, many a sprucer public- house.</s> <s sid="3" id="OMF.c6.s3">Externally, it was a narrow lopsided wooden jumble of corpulent windows heaped one upon another as you might heap as many toppling oranges, with a crazy wooden verandah impending over the water; indeed the whole house, inclusive of the complaining flag-staff on the roof, impended over the water, but seemed to have got into the condition of a faint-hearted diver who has paused so long on the brink that he will never go in at all.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OMF.c6.p2"><s sid="4" id="OMF.c6.s4">This description applies to the river-frontage of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters.</s> <s sid="5" id="OMF.c6.s5">The back of the establishment, though the chief entrance was there, so contracted that it merely represented in its connexion with the front, the handle of a flat iron set upright on its broadest end.</s> <s sid="6" id="OMF.c6.s6">This handle stood at the bottom of a wilderness of court and alley: which wilderness pressed so hard and close upon the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters as to leave the hostelry not an inch of ground beyond its door.</s> <s sid="7" id="OMF.c6.s7">For this reason, in combination with the fact that the house was all but afloat at high water, when the Porters had a family wash the linen subjected to that operation might usually be seen drying on lines stretched across the reception-rooms and bed-chambers.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OMF.c6.p3"><s sid="8" id="OMF.c6.s8">The wood forming the chimney-pieces, beams, partitions, floors and doors, of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, seemed in its old age fraught with confused memories of its youth.</s> <s sid="9" id="OMF.c6.s9">In many places it had become gnarled and riven, according to the manner of old trees; knots started out of it; and here and there it seemed to twist itself into some likeness of boughs.</s> <s sid="10" id="OMF.c6.s10">In this state of second childhood, it had an air of being in its own way garrulous about its early life.</s> <s sid="11" id="OMF.c6.s11">Not without reason was it often asserted by the regular frequenters of the Porters, that when the light shone full upon the grain of certain panels, and particularly upon an old corner cupboard of walnut-wood in the bar, you might trace little forests there, and tiny trees like the parent tree, in full umbrageous leaf.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="OMF.c18.p1"><s sid="1" id="OMF.c18.s1">The school at which young Charley Hexam had first learned from a book--the streets being, for pupils of his degree, the great Preparatory Establishment in which very much that is never unlearned is learned without and before book--was a miserable loft in an unsavoury yard.</s> <s sid="2" id="OMF.c18.s2">Its atmosphere was oppressive and disagreeable; it was crowded, noisy, and confusing; half the pupils dropped asleep, or fell into a state of waking stupefaction; the other half kept them in either condition by maintaining a monotonous droning noise, as if they were performing, out of time and tune, on a ruder sort of bagpipe.</s> <s sid="3" id="OMF.c18.s3">The teachers, animated solely by good intentions, had no idea of execution, and a lamentable jumble was the upshot of their kind endeavours.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OMF.c18.p2"><s sid="4" id="OMF.c18.s4">It was a school for all ages, and for both sexes.</s> <s sid="5" id="OMF.c18.s5">The latter were kept apart, and the former were partitioned off into square assortments.</s> <s sid="6" id="OMF.c18.s6">But, all the place was pervaded by a grimly ludicrous pretence that every pupil was childish and innocent.</s> <s sid="7" id="OMF.c18.s7">This pretence, much favoured by the lady-visitors, led to the ghastliest absurdities.</s> <s sid="8" id="OMF.c18.s8">Young women old in the vices of the commonest and worst life, were expected to profess themselves enthralled by the good child's book, the Adventures of Little Margery, who resided in the village cottage by the mill; severely reproved and morally squashed the miller, when she was five and he was fifty; divided her porridge with singing birds; denied herself a new nankeen bonnet, on the ground that the turnips did not wear nankeen bonnets, neither did the sheep who ate them; who plaited straw and delivered the dreariest orations to all comers, at all sorts of unseasonable times.</s> <s sid="9" id="OMF.c18.s9">So, unwieldy young dredgers and hulking mudlarks were referred to the experiences of Thomas Twopence, who, having resolved not to rob (under circumstances of uncommon atrocity) his particular friend and benefactor, of eighteenpence, presently came into supernatural possession of three and sixpence, and lived a shining light ever afterwards.</s> <s sid="10" id="OMF.c18.s10">(Note, that the benefactor came to no good.)</s> <s sid="11" id="OMF.c18.s11">Several swaggering sinners had written their own biographies in the same strain; it always appearing from the lessons of those very boastful persons, that you were to do good, not because it WAS good, but because you were to make a good thing of it.</s> <s sid="12" id="OMF.c18.s12">Contrariwise, the adult pupils were taught to read (if they could learn) out of the New Testament; and by dint of stumbling over the syllables and keeping their bewildered eyes on the particular syllables coming round to their turn, were as absolutely ignorant of the sublime history, as if they had never seen or heard of it.</s> <s sid="13" id="OMF.c18.s13">An exceedingly and confoundingly perplexing jumble of a school, in fact, where black spirits and grey, red spirits and white, jumbled jumbled jumbled jumbled, jumbled every night.</s> <s sid="14" id="OMF.c18.s14">And particularly every Sunday night.</s> <s sid="15" id="OMF.c18.s15">For then, an inclined plane of unfortunate infants would be handed over to the prosiest and worst of all the teachers with good intentions, whom nobody older would endure.</s> <s sid="16" id="OMF.c18.s16">Who, taking his stand on the floor before them as chief executioner, would be attended by a conventional volunteer boy as executioner's assistant.</s> <s sid="17" id="OMF.c18.s17">When and where it first became the conventional system that a weary or inattentive infant in a class must have its face smoothed downward with a hot hand, or when and where the conventional volunteer boy first beheld such system in operation, and became inflamed with a sacred zeal to administer it, matters not.</s> <s sid="18" id="OMF.c18.s18">It was the function of the chief executioner to hold forth, and it was the function of the acolyte to dart at sleeping infants, yawning infants, restless infants, whimpering infants, and smooth their wretched faces; sometimes with one hand, as if he were anointing them for a whisker; sometimes with both hands, applied after the fashion of blinkers.</s> <s sid="19" id="OMF.c18.s19">And so the jumble would be in action in this department for a mortal hour; the exponent drawling on to My Dearert Childerrenerr, let us say, for example, about the beautiful coming to the Sepulchre; and repeating the word Sepulchre (commonly used among infants) five hundred times, and never once hinting what it meant; the conventional boy smoothing away right and left, as an infallible commentary; the whole hot-bed of flushed and exhausted infants exchanging measles, rashes, whooping-cough, fever, and stomach disorders, as if they were assembled in High Market for the purpose.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OMF.c18.p3"><s sid="20" id="OMF.c18.s20">Even in this temple of good intentions, an exceptionally sharp boy exceptionally determined to learn, could learn something, and, having learned it, could impart it much better than the teachers; as being more knowing than they, and not at the disadvantage in which they stood towards the shrewder pupils.</s> <s sid="21" id="OMF.c18.s21">In this way it had come about that Charley Hexam had risen in the jumble, taught in the jumble, and been received from the jumble into a better school.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="OMF.c24.p1"><s sid="1" id="OMF.c24.s1">The arrangement between Mr Boffin and his literary man, Mr Silas Wegg, so far altered with the altered habits of Mr Boffin's life, as that the Roman Empire usually declined in the morning and in the eminently aristocratic family mansion, rather than in the evening, as of yore, and in Boffin's Bower.</s> <s sid="2" id="OMF.c24.s2">There were occasions, however, when Mr Boffin, seeking a brief refuge from the blandishments of fashion, would present himself at the Bower after dark, to anticipate the next sallying forth of Wegg, and would there, on the old settle, pursue the downward fortunes of those enervated and corrupted masters of the world who were by this time on their last legs.</s> <s sid="3" id="OMF.c24.s3">If Wegg had been worse paid for his office, or better qualified to discharge it, he would have considered these visits complimentary and agreeable; but, holding the position of a handsomely-remunerated humbug, he resented them.</s> <s sid="4" id="OMF.c24.s4">This was quite according to rule, for the incompetent servant, by whomsoever employed, is always against his employer.</s> <s sid="5" id="OMF.c24.s5">Even those born governors, noble and right honourable creatures, who have been the most imbecile in high places, have uniformly shown themselves the most opposed (sometimes in belying distrust, sometimes in vapid insolence) to THEIR employer.</s> <s sid="6" id="OMF.c24.s6">What is in such wise true of the public master and servant, is equally true of the private master and servant all the world over.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="OMF.c27.p1"><s sid="1" id="OMF.c27.s1">Some of the Reverend Frank Milvey's brethren had found themselves exceedingly uncomfortable in their minds, because they were required to bury the dead too hopefully.</s> <s sid="2" id="OMF.c27.s2">But, the Reverend Frank, inclining to the belief that they were required to do one or two other things (say out of nine-and-thirty) calculated to trouble their consciences rather more if they would think as much about them, held his peace.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OMF.c27.p2"><s sid="3" id="OMF.c27.s3">Indeed, the Reverend Frank Milvey was a forbearing man, who noticed many sad warps and blights in the vineyard wherein he worked, and did not profess that they made him savagely wise.</s> <s sid="4" id="OMF.c27.s4">He only learned that the more he himself knew, in his little limited human way, the better he could distantly imagine what Omniscience might know.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OMF.c27.p3"><s sid="5" id="OMF.c27.s5">Wherefore, if the Reverend Frank had had to read the words that troubled some of his brethren, and profitably touched innumerable hearts, in a worse case than Johnny's, he would have done so out of the pity and humility of his soul.</s> <s sid="6" id="OMF.c27.s6">Reading them over Johnny, he thought of his own six children, but not of his poverty, and read them with dimmed eyes.</s> <s sid="7" id="OMF.c27.s7">And very seriously did he and his bright little wife, who had been listening, look down into the small grave and walk home arm-in-arm.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OMF.c27.p4"><s sid="8" id="OMF.c27.s8">There was grief in the aristocratic house, and there was joy in the Bower.</s> <s sid="9" id="OMF.c27.s9">Mr Wegg argued, if an orphan were wanted, was he not an orphan himself; and could a better be desired?</s> <s sid="10" id="OMF.c27.s10">And why go beating about Brentford bushes, seeking orphans forsooth who had established no claims upon you and made no sacrifices for you, when here was an orphan ready to your hand who had given up in your cause, Miss Elizabeth, Master George, Aunt Jane, and Uncle Parker?</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="OMF.c27.p5"><s sid="11" id="OMF.c27.s11">Mr Wegg chuckled, consequently, when he heard the tidings.</s> <s sid="12" id="OMF.c27.s12">Nay, it was afterwards affirmed by a witness who shall at present be nameless, that in the seclusion of the Bower he poked out his wooden leg, in the stage-ballet manner, and executed a taunting or triumphant pirouette on the genuine leg remaining to him.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="OMF.c27.p6"><s sid="13" id="OMF.c27.s13">John Rokesmith's manner towards Mrs Boffin at this time, was more the manner of a young man towards a mother, than that of a Secretary towards his employer's wife.</s> <s sid="14" id="OMF.c27.s14">It had always been marked by a subdued affectionate deference that seemed to have sprung up on the very day of his engagement; whatever was odd in her dress or her ways had seemed to have no oddity for him; he had sometimes borne a quietly-amused face in her company, but still it had seemed as if the pleasure her genial temper and radiant nature yielded him, could have been quite as naturally expressed in a tear as in a smile.</s> <s sid="15" id="OMF.c27.s15">The completeness of his sympathy with her fancy for having a little John Harmon to protect and rear, he had shown in every act and word, and now that the kind fancy was disappointed, he treated it with a manly tenderness and respect for which she could hardly thank him enough.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="OMF.c29.p1"><s sid="1" id="OMF.c29.s1">Rogue Riderhood dwelt deep and dark in Limehouse Hole, among the riggers, and the mast, oar and block makers, and the boat- builders, and the sail-lofts, as in a kind of ship's hold stored full of waterside characters, some no better than himself, some very much better, and none much worse.</s> <s sid="2" id="OMF.c29.s2">The Hole, albeit in a general way not over nice in its choice of company, was rather shy in reference to the honour of cultivating the Rogue's acquaintance; more frequently giving him the cold shoulder than the warm hand, and seldom or never drinking with him unless at his own expense.</s> <s sid="3" id="OMF.c29.s3">A part of the Hole, indeed, contained so much public spirit and private virtue that not even this strong leverage could move it to good fellowship with a tainted accuser.</s> <s sid="4" id="OMF.c29.s4">But, there may have been the drawback on this magnanimous morality, that its exponents held a true witness before Justice to be the next unneighbourly and accursed character to a false one.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OMF.c29.p2"><s sid="5" id="OMF.c29.s5">Had it not been for the daughter whom he often mentioned, Mr Riderhood might have found the Hole a mere grave as to any means it would yield him of getting a living.</s> <s sid="6" id="OMF.c29.s6">But Miss Pleasant Riderhood had some little position and connection in Limehouse Hole.</s> <s sid="7" id="OMF.c29.s7">Upon the smallest of small scales, she was an unlicensed pawnbroker, keeping what was popularly called a Leaving Shop, by lending insignificant sums on insignificant articles of property deposited with her as security.</s> <s sid="8" id="OMF.c29.s8">In her four-and-twentieth year of life, Pleasant was already in her fifth year of this way of trade.</s> <s sid="9" id="OMF.c29.s9">Her deceased mother had established the business, and on that parent's demise she had appropriated a secret capital of fifteen shillings to establishing herself in it; the existence of such capital in a pillow being the last intelligible confidential communication made to her by the departed, before succumbing to dropsical conditions of snuff and gin, incompatible equally with coherence and existence.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OMF.c29.p3"><s sid="10" id="OMF.c29.s10">Why christened Pleasant, the late Mrs Riderhood might possibly have been at some time able to explain, and possibly not.</s> <s sid="11" id="OMF.c29.s11">Her daughter had no information on that point.</s> <s sid="12" id="OMF.c29.s12">Pleasant she found herself, and she couldn't help it.</s> <s sid="13" id="OMF.c29.s13">She had not been consulted on the question, any more than on the question of her coming into these terrestrial parts, to want a name.</s> <s sid="14" id="OMF.c29.s14">Similarly, she found herself possessed of what is colloquially termed a swivel eye (derived from her father), which she might perhaps have declined if her sentiments on the subject had been taken.</s> <s sid="15" id="OMF.c29.s15">She was not otherwise positively ill-looking, though anxious, meagre, of a muddy complexion, and looking as old again as she really was.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OMF.c29.p4"><s sid="16" id="OMF.c29.s16">As some dogs have it in the blood, or are trained, to worry certain creatures to a certain point, so--not to make the comparison disrespectfially--Pleasant Riderhood had it in the blood, or had been trained, to regard seamen, within certain limits, as her prey.</s> <s sid="17" id="OMF.c29.s17">Show her a man in a blue jacket, and, figuratively speaking, she pinned him instantly.</s> <s sid="18" id="OMF.c29.s18">Yet, all things considered, she was not of an evil mind or an unkindly disposition.</s> <s sid="19" id="OMF.c29.s19">For, observe how many things were to be considered according to her own unfortunate experience.</s> <s sid="20" id="OMF.c29.s20">Show Pleasant Riderhood a Wedding in the street, and she only saw two people taking out a regular licence to quarrel and fight.</s> <s sid="21" id="OMF.c29.s21">Show her a Christening, and she saw a little heathen personage having a quite superfluous name bestowed upon it, inasmuch as it would be commonly addressed by some abusive epithet: which little personage was not in the least wanted by anybody, and would be shoved and banged out of everybody's way, until it should grow big enough to shove and bang.</s> <s sid="22" id="OMF.c29.s22">Show her a Funeral, and she saw an unremunerative ceremony in the nature of a black masquerade, conferring a temporary gentility on the performers, at an immense expense, and representing the only formal party ever given by the deceased.</s> <s sid="23" id="OMF.c29.s23">Show her a live father, and she saw but a duplicate of her own father, who from her infancy had been taken with fits and starts of discharging his duty to her, which duty was always incorporated in the form of a fist or a leathern strap, and being discharged hurt her.</s> <s sid="24" id="OMF.c29.s24">All things considered, therefore, Pleasant Riderhood was not so very, very bad.</s> <s sid="25" id="OMF.c29.s25">There was even a touch of romance in her--of such romance as could creep into Limehouse Hole--and maybe sometimes of a summer evening, when she stood with folded arms at her shop- door, looking from the reeking street to the sky where the sun was setting, she may have had some vaporous visions of far-off islands in the southern seas or elsewhere (not being geographically particular), where it would be good to roam with a congenial partner among groves of bread-fruit, waiting for ships to be wafted from the hollow ports of civilization.</s> <s sid="26" id="OMF.c29.s26">For, sailors to be got the better of, were essential to Miss Pleasant's Eden.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="OMF.c29.p5"><s sid="27" id="OMF.c29.s27">Not on a summer evening did she come to her little shop-door, when a certain man standing over against the house on the opposite side of the street took notice of her.</s> <s sid="28" id="OMF.c29.s28">That was on a cold shrewd windy evening, after dark.</s> <s sid="29" id="OMF.c29.s29">Pleasant Riderhood shared with most of the lady inhabitants of the Hole, the peculiarity that her hair was a ragged knot, constantly coming down behind, and that she never could enter upon any undertaking without first twisting it into place.</s> <s sid="30" id="OMF.c29.s30">At that particular moment, being newly come to the threshold to take a look out of doors, she was winding herself up with both hands after this fashion.</s> <s sid="31" id="OMF.c29.s31">And so prevalent was the fashion, that on the occasion of a fight or other disturbance in the Hole, the ladies would be seen flocking from all quarters universally twisting their back-hair as they came along, and many of them, in the hurry of the moment, carrying their back-combs in their mouths.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="OMF.c29.p6"><s sid="32" id="OMF.c29.s32">It was a wretched little shop, with a roof that any man standing in it could touch with his hand; little better than a cellar or cave, down three steps.</s> <s sid="33" id="OMF.c29.s33">Yet in its ill-lighted window, among a flaring handkerchief or two, an old peacoat or so, a few valueless watches and compasses, a jar of tobacco and two crossed pipes, a bottle of walnut ketchup, and some horrible sweets  these creature discomforts serving as a blind to the main business of the Leaving Shop--was displayed the inscription SEAMAN'S BOARDING-HOUSE.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="OMF.c29.p7"><s sid="34" id="OMF.c29.s34">Taking notice of Pleasant Riderhood at the door, the man crossed so quickly that she was still winding herself up, when he stood close before her.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="OMF.c34.p1"><s sid="1" id="OMF.c34.s1">It was a foggy day in London, and the fog was heavy and dark.</s> <s sid="2" id="OMF.c34.s2">Animate London, with smarting eyes and irritated lungs, was blinking, wheezing, and choking; inanimate London was a sooty spectre, divided in purpose between being visible and invisible, and so being wholly neither.</s> <s sid="3" id="OMF.c34.s3">Gaslights flared in the shops with a haggard and unblest air, as knowing themselves to be night- creatures that had no business abroad under the sun; while the sun itself when it was for a few moments dimly indicated through circling eddies of fog, showed as if it had gone out and were collapsing flat and cold.</s> <s sid="4" id="OMF.c34.s4">Even in the surrounding country it was a foggy day, but there the fog was grey, whereas in London it was, at about the boundary line, dark yellow, and a little within it brown, and then browner, and then browner, until at the heart of the City-- which call Saint Mary Axe--it was rusty-black.</s> <s sid="5" id="OMF.c34.s5">From any point of the high ridge of land northward, it might have been discerned that the loftiest buildings made an occasional struggle to get their heads above the foggy sea, and especially that the great dome of Saint Paul's seemed to die hard; but this was not perceivable in the streets at their feet, where the whole metropolis was a heap of vapour charged with muffled sound of wheels, and enfolding a gigantic catarrh.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OMF.c34.p2"><s sid="6" id="OMF.c34.s6">At nine o'clock on such a morning, the place of business of Pubsey and Co. was not the liveliest object even in Saint Mary Axe--which is not a very lively spot--with a sobbing gaslight in the counting- house window, and a burglarious stream of fog creeping in to strangle it through the keyhole of the main door.</s> <s sid="7" id="OMF.c34.s7">But the light went out, and the main door opened, and Riah came forth with a bag under his arm.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OMF.c34.p3"><s sid="8" id="OMF.c34.s8">Almost in the act of coming out at the door, Riah went into the fog, and was lost to the eyes of Saint Mary Axe.</s> <s sid="9" id="OMF.c34.s9">But the eyes of this history can follow him westward, by Cornhill, Cheapside, Fleet Street, and the Strand, to Piccadilly and the Albany.</s> <s sid="10" id="OMF.c34.s10">Thither he went at his grave and measured pace, staff in hand, skirt at heel; and more than one head, turning to look back at his venerable figure already lost in the mist, supposed it to be some ordinary figure indistinctly seen, which fancy and the fog had worked into that passing likeness.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OMF.c34.p4"><s sid="11" id="OMF.c34.s11">Arrived at the house in which his master's chambers were on the second floor, Riah proceeded up the stairs, and paused at Fascination Fledgeby's door.</s> <s sid="12" id="OMF.c34.s12">Making free with neither bell nor knocker, he struck upon the door with the top of his staff, and, having listened, sat down on the threshold.</s> <s sid="13" id="OMF.c34.s13">It was characteristic of his habitual submission, that he sat down on the raw dark staircase, as many of his ancestors had probably sat down in dungeons, taking what befell him as it might befall.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="OMF.c47.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="OMF.c47.s1">Having assisted at a few more expositions of the lives of Misers, Mr Venus became almost indispensable to the evenings at the Bower.</s> <s sid="2" id="OMF.c47.s2">The circumstance of having another listener to the wonders unfolded by Wegg, or, as it were, another calculator to cast up the guineas found in teapots, chimneys, racks and mangers, and other such banks of deposit, seemed greatly to heighten Mr Boffin's enjoyment; while Silas Wegg, for his part, though of a jealous temperament which might under ordinary circumstances have resented the anatomist's getting into favour, was so very anxious to keep his eye on that gentleman--lest, being too much left to himself, he should be tempted to play any tricks with the precious document in his keeping--that he never lost an opportunity of commending him to Mr Boffin's notice as a third party whose company was much to be desired.</s> <s sid="3" id="OMF.c47.s3">Another friendly demonstration towards him Mr Wegg now regularly gratified.</s> <s sid="4" id="OMF.c47.s4">After each sitting was over, and the patron had departed, Mr Wegg invariably saw Mr Venus home.</s> <s sid="5" id="OMF.c47.s5">To be sure, he as invariably requested to be refreshed with a sight of the paper in which he was a joint proprietor; but he never failed to remark that it was the great pleasure he derived from Mr Venus's improving society which had insensibly lured him round to Clerkenwell again, and that, finding himself once more attracted to the spot by the social powers of Mr V., he would beg leave to go through that little incidental procedure, as a matter of form.</s> <s sid="6" id="OMF.c47.s6"><qs/>'For well I know, sir,'<qe/><sss/> Mr Wegg would add, <sse/><qs/>'that a man of your delicate mind would wish to be checked off whenever the opportunity arises, and it is not for me to baulk your feelings.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="2" id="OMF.c47.p2"><s sid="7" id="OMF.c47.s7">A certain rustiness in Mr Venus, which never became so lubricated by the oil of Mr Wegg but that he turned under the screw in a creaking and stiff manner, was very noticeable at about this period.</s> <s sid="8" id="OMF.c47.s8">While assisting at the literary evenings, he even went so far, on two or three occasions, as to correct Mr Wegg when he grossly mispronounced a word, or made nonsense of a passage; insomuch that Mr Wegg took to surveying his course in the day, and to making arrangements for getting round rocks at night instead of running straight upon them.</s> <s sid="9" id="OMF.c47.s9">Of the slightest anatomical reference he became particularly shy, and, if he saw a bone ahead, would go any distance out of his way rather than mention it by name.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OMF.c47.p3"><s sid="10" id="OMF.c47.s10">The adverse destinies ordained that one evening Mr Wegg's labouring bark became beset by polysyllables, and embarrassed among a perfect archipelago of hard words.</s> <s sid="11" id="OMF.c47.s11">It being necessary to take soundings every minute, and to feel the way with the greatest caution, Mr Wegg's attention was fully employed.</s> <s sid="12" id="OMF.c47.s12">Advantage was taken of this dilemma by Mr Venus, to pass a scrap of paper into Mr Boffin's hand, and lay his finger on his own lip.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OMF.c47.p4" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="OMF.c47.s13">When Mr Boffin got home at night he found that the paper contained Mr Venus's card and these words:</s> <s sid="14" id="OMF.c47.s14"><qs/>'Should be glad to be honoured with a call respecting business of your own, about dusk on an early evening.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="OMF.c47.p5"><s sid="15" id="OMF.c47.s15">The very next evening saw Mr Boffin peeping in at the preserved frogs in Mr Venus's shop-window, and saw Mr Venus espying Mr Boffin with the readiness of one on the alert, and beckoning that gentleman into his interior.</s> <s sid="16" id="OMF.c47.s16">Responding, Mr Boffin was invited to seat himself on the box of human miscellanies before the fire, and did so, looking round the place with admiring eyes.</s> <s sid="17" id="OMF.c47.s17">The fire being low and fitful, and the dusk gloomy, the whole stock seemed to be winking and blinking with both eyes, as Mr Venus did.</s> <s sid="18" id="OMF.c47.s18">The French gentleman, though he had no eyes, was not at all behind- hand, but appeared, as the flame rose and fell, to open and shut his no eyes, with the regularity of the glass-eyed dogs and ducks and birds.</s> <s sid="19" id="OMF.c47.s19">The big-headed babies were equally obliging in lending their grotesque aid to the general effect.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="OMF.c47.p6" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="OMF.c47.s20"><qs/>'You see, Mr Venus, I've lost no time,'<qe/> said Mr Boffin.</s> <s sid="21" id="OMF.c47.s21"><qs/>'Here I am.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="7" id="OMF.c47.p7" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="OMF.c47.s22"><qs/>'Here you are, sir,'<qe/> assented Mr Venus.</s> </p><p pid="8" id="OMF.c47.p8" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="OMF.c47.s23"><qs/>'I don't like secrecy,'<qe/><sss/> pursued Mr Boffin--<sse/><qs/>'at least, not in a general way I don't--but I dare say you'll show me good reason for being secret so far.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="9" id="OMF.c47.p9" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="OMF.c47.s24"><qs/>'I think I shall, sir,'<qe/> returned Venus.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="OMF.c47.p10" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="OMF.c47.s25"><qs/>'Good,'<qe/> said Mr Boffin.</s> <s sid="26" id="OMF.c47.s26"><qs/>'You don't expect Wegg, I take it for granted?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="OMF.c47.p11" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="OMF.c47.s27"><qs/>'No, sir.</s> <s sid="28" id="OMF.c47.s28">I expect no one but the present company.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="12" id="OMF.c47.p12" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="OMF.c47.s29">Mr Boffin glanced about him, as accepting under that inclusive denomination the French gentleman and the circle in which he didn't move, and repeated, <qs/>'The present company.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="OMF.c47.p13" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="OMF.c47.s30"><qs/>'Sir,'<qe/><sss/> said Mr Venus, <sse/><qs/>'before entering upon business, I shall have to ask you for your word and honour that we are in confidence.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="OMF.c47.p14" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="OMF.c47.s31"><qs/>'Let's wait a bit and understand what the expression means,'<qe/> answered Mr Boffin.</s> <s sid="32" id="OMF.c47.s32"><qs/>'In confidence for how long?</s> <s sid="33" id="OMF.c47.s33">In confidence for ever and a day?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="OMF.c47.p15" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="OMF.c47.s34"><qs/>'I take your hint, sir,'<qe/><sss/> said Venus; <sse/><qs/>'you think you might consider the business, when you came to know it, to be of a nature incompatible with confidence on your part?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="16" id="OMF.c47.p16" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="OMF.c47.s35"><qs/>'I might,'<qe/> said Mr Boffin with a cautious look.</s> </p><p pid="17" id="OMF.c47.p17" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="OMF.c47.s36"><qs/>'True, sir.</s> <s sid="37" id="OMF.c47.s37">Well, sir,'<qe/><sls/> observed Venus, after clutching at his dusty hair, to brighten his ideas, <sle/><qs/>'let us put it another way.</s> <s sid="38" id="OMF.c47.s38">I open the business with you, relying upon your honour not to do anything in it, and not to mention me in it, without my knowledge.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="18" id="OMF.c47.p18" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="OMF.c47.s39"><qs/>'That sounds fair,'<qe/> said Mr Boffin.</s> <s sid="40" id="OMF.c47.s40"><qs/>'I agree to that.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="OMF.c47.p19" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="OMF.c47.s41"><qs/>'I have your word and honour, sir?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="20" id="OMF.c47.p20" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="OMF.c47.s42"><qs/>'My good fellow,'<qe/><sss/> retorted Mr Boffin, <sse/><qs/>'you have my word; and how you can have that, without my honour too, I don't know.</s> <s sid="43" id="OMF.c47.s43">I've sorted a lot of dust in my time, but I never knew the two things go into separate heaps.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="21" id="OMF.c47.p21" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="OMF.c47.s44">This remark seemed rather to abash Mr Venus.</s> <s sid="45" id="OMF.c47.s45">He hesitated, and said, <qs/>'Very true, sir;' and again, 'Very true, sir,'<qe/> before resuming the thread of his discourse.</s> </p><p pid="22" id="OMF.c47.p22" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="OMF.c47.s46"><qs/>'Mr Boffin, if I confess to you that I fell into a proposal of which you were the subject, and of which you oughtn't to have been the subject, you will allow me to mention, and will please take into favourable consideration, that I was in a crushed state of mind at the time.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="OMF.c47.p23" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="OMF.c47.s47">The Golden Dustman, with his hands folded on the top of his stout stick, with his chin resting upon them, and with something leering and whimsical in his eyes, gave a nod, and said, <qs/>'Quite so, Venus.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="24" id="OMF.c47.p24" type="speech"><s sid="48" id="OMF.c47.s48"><qs/>'That proposal, sir, was a conspiring breach of your confidence, to such an extent, that I ought at once to have made it known to you.</s> <s sid="49" id="OMF.c47.s49">But I didn't, Mr Boffin, and I fell into it.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="OMF.c47.p25" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="OMF.c47.s50">Without moving eye or finger, Mr Boffin gave another nod, and placidly repeated, <qs/>'Quite so, Venus.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="26" id="OMF.c47.p26" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="OMF.c47.s51"><qs/>'Not that I was ever hearty in it, sir,'<qe/><sls/> the penitent anatomist went on, <sle/><qs/>'or that I ever viewed myself with anything but reproach for having turned out of the paths of science into the paths of--' he was going to say 'villany,'<qe/><sls/> but, unwilling to press too hard upon himself, substituted with great emphasis--<sle/><qs/>'Weggery.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="27" id="OMF.c47.p27"><s sid="52" id="OMF.c47.s52">Placid and whimsical of look as ever, Mr Boffin answered:</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="OMF.c47.p34" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="OMF.c47.s64"><qs/>'Now, sir,'<qe/><sss/> said Venus, finishing off; <sse/><qs/>'you best know what was in that Dutch bottle, and why you dug

price, and I build that opinion on his beginning to dispose of your property the moment he knew his power.</s> <s sid="71" id="OMF.c47.s71">Whether it's worth your while to silence him at any price, you will decide for yourself, and take your measures accordingly.</s> <s sid="72" id="OMF.c47.s72">As far as I am concerned, I have no price.</s> <s sid="73" id="OMF.c47.s73">If I am ever called upon

<p pid="1" id="OMF.c50.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="OMF.c50.s1">Amazement sits enthroned upon the countenances of Mr and Mrs Alfred Lammle's circle of acquaintance, when the disposal of their first-class furniture and effects (including a Billiard Table in capital letters), <qs/>'by auction, under a bill of sale,'<qe/> is publicly announced on a waving hearthrug in Sackville Street.</s> <s sid="2" id="OMF.c50.s2">But, nobody is half so much amazed as Hamilton Veneering, Esquire, M.P. for Pocket-Breaches, who instantly begins to find out that the Lammles are the only people ever entered on his soul's register, who are NOT the oldest and dearest friends he has in the world.</s> <s sid="3" id="OMF.c50.s3">Mrs Veneering, W.M.P. for Pocket-Breaches, like a faithful wife shares her husband's discovery and inexpressible astonishment.</s> <s sid="4" id="OMF.c50.s4">Perhaps the Veneerings twain may deem the last unutterable feeling particularly due to their reputation, by reason that once upon a time some of the longer heads in the City are whispered to have shaken themselves, when Veneering's extensive dealings and great wealth were mentioned.</s> <s sid="5" id="OMF.c50.s5">But, it is certain that neither Mr nor Mrs Veneering can find words to wonder in, and it becomes necessary that they give to the oldest and dearest friends they have in the world, a wondering dinner.</s> </p><p pid="2" id="OMF.c50.p2"><s sid="6" id="OMF.c50.s6">For, it is by this time noticeable that, whatever befals, the Veneerings must give a dinner upon it.</s> <s sid="7" id="OMF.c50.s7">Lady Tippins lives in a chronic state of invitation to dine with the Veneerings, and in a chronic state of inflammation arising from the dinners.</s> <s sid="8" id="OMF.c50.s8">Boots and Brewer go about in cabs, with no other intelligible business on earth than to beat up people to come and dine with the Veneerings.</s> <s sid="9" id="OMF.c50.s9">Veneering pervades the legislative lobbies, intent upon entrapping his fellow-legislators to dinner.</s> <s sid="10" id="OMF.c50.s10">Mrs Veneering dined with five- and-twenty bran-new faces over night; calls upon them all to day; sends them every one a dinner-card to-morrow, for the week after next; before that dinner is digested, calls upon their brothers and sisters, their sons and daughters, their nephews and nieces, their aunts and uncles and cousins, and invites them all to dinner.</s> <s sid="11" id="OMF.c50.s11">And still, as at first, howsoever, the dining circle widens, it is to be observed that all the diners are consistent in appearing to go to the Veneerings, not to dine with Mr and Mrs Veneering (which would seem to be the last thing in their minds), but to dine with one another.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OMF.c50.p3" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="OMF.c50.s12">Perhaps, after all,--who knows?--Veneering may find this dining, though expensive, remunerative, in the sense that it makes champions.</s> <s sid="13" id="OMF.c50.s13">Mr Podsnap, as a representative man, is not alone in caring very particularly for his own dignity, if not for that of his acquaintances, and therefore in angrily supporting the acquaintances who have taken out his Permit, lest, in their being lessened, he should be.</s> <s sid="14" id="OMF.c50.s14">The gold and silver camels, and the ice- pails, and the rest of the Veneering table decorations, make a brilliant show, and when I, Podsnap, casually remark elsewhere that I dined last Monday with a gorgeous caravan of camels, I find it personally offensive to have it hinted to me that they are broken- kneed camels, or camels labouring under suspicion of any sort.</s> <s sid="15" id="OMF.c50.s15"><qs/>'I don't display camels myself, I am above them:</s> <s sid="16" id="OMF.c50.s16">I am a more solid man; but these camels have basked in the light of my countenance, and how dare you, sir, insinuate to me that I have irradiated any but unimpeachable camels?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="4" id="OMF.c50.p4" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="OMF.c50.s17">The camels are polishing up in the Analytical's pantry for the dinner of wonderment on the occasion of the Lammles going to pieces, and Mr Twemlow feels a little queer on the sofa at his lodgings over the stable yard in Duke Street, Saint James's, in consequence of having taken two advertised pills at about mid-day, on the faith of the printed representation accompanying the box (price one and a penny halfpenny, government stamp included), that the same <qs/>'will be found highly salutary as a precautionary measure in connection with the pleasures of the table.'<qe/></s> <s sid="18" id="OMF.c50.s18">To whom, while sickly with the fancy of an insoluble pill sticking in his gullet, and also with the sensation of a deposit of warm gum languidly wandering within him a little lower down, a servant enters with the announcement that a lady wishes to speak with him.</s> </p><p pid="5" id="OMF.c50.p5" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="OMF.c50.s19"><qs/>'A lady!'<qe/> says Twemlow, pluming his ruffled feathers.</s> <s sid="20" id="OMF.c50.s20"><qs/>'Ask the favour of the lady's name.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="OMF.c50.p6"><s sid="21" id="OMF.c50.s21">The lady's name is Lammle.</s> <s sid="22" id="OMF.c50.s22">The lady will not detain Mr Twemlow longer than a very few minutes.</s> <s sid="23" id="OMF.c50.s23">The lady is sure that Mr Twemlow will do her the kindness to see her, on being told that she particularly desires a short interview.</s> <s sid="24" id="OMF.c50.s24">The lady has no doubt whatever of Mr Twemlow's compliance when he hears her name.</s> <s sid="25" id="OMF.c50.s25">Has begged the servant to be particular not to mistake her name.</s> <s sid="26" id="OMF.c50.s26">Would have sent in a card, but has none.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="OMF.c50.p9" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="OMF.c50.s30"><qs/>'Pray take a seat, Mrs Lammle.'<qe/></s> <s sid="31" id="OMF.c50.s31">Mrs Lammle takes a seat and opens the conversation.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="OMF.c50.p10" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="OMF.c50.s32"><qs/>'I have no doubt, Mr Twemlow, that you have heard of a reverse of fortune having befallen us.</s> <s sid="33" id="OMF.c50.s33">Of course you have heard of it, for no kind of news travels so fast--among one's friends especially.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="OMF.c50.p11"><s sid="34" id="OMF.c50.s34">Mindful of the wondering dinner, Twemlow, with a little twinge, admits the imputation.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="OMF.c50.p12" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="OMF.c50.s35"><qs/>'Probably it will not,'<qe/><sls/> says Mrs Lammle, with a certain hardened manner upon her, that makes Twemlow shrink, <sle/><qs/>'have surprised you so much as some others, after what passed between us at the house which is now turned out at windows.</s> <s sid="36" id="OMF.c50.s36">I have taken the liberty of calling upon you, Mr Twemlow, to add a sort of postscript to what I said that day.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="OMF.c50.p13"><s sid="37" id="OMF.c50.s37">Mr Twemlow's dry and hollow cheeks become more dry and hollow at the prospect of some new complication.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="OMF.c50.p14" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="OMF.c50.s38"><qs/>'Really,'<qe/><sls/> says the uneasy little gentleman, <sle/><qs/>'really, Mrs Lammle, I should take it as a favour if you could excuse me from any further confidence.</s> <s sid="39" id="OMF.c50.s39">It has ever been one of the objects of my life--which, unfortunately, has not had many objects--to be inoffensive, and to keep out of cabals and interferences.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="OMF.c50.p15"><s sid="40" id="OMF.c50.s40">Mrs Lammle, by far the more observant of the two, scarcely finds it necessary to look at Twemlow while he speaks, so easily does she read him.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OMF.c63.p2"><s sid="5" id="OMF.c63.s5">Mrs Boffin seated Bella on the large ottoman, and seated herself beside her, and John her husband seated himself on the other side of her, and Mr Boffin stood beaming at every one and everything he could see, with surpassing jollity and enjoyment.</s> <s sid="6" id="OMF.c63.s6">Mrs Boffin was then taken with a laughing fit of clapping her hands, and clapping her knees, and rocking herself to and fro, and then with another laughing fit of embracing Bella, and rocking her to and fro--both fits, of considerable duration.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OMF.c65.p2"><s sid="3" id="OMF.c65.s3">First, he had to bear the combined weight of the knowledge of what he had done, of that haunting reproach that he might have done it so much better, and of the dread of discovery.</s> <s sid="4" id="OMF.c65.s4">This was load enough to crush him, and he laboured under it day and night.</s> <s sid="5" id="OMF.c65.s5">It was as heavy on him in his scanty sleep, as in his red-eyed waking hours.</s> <s sid="6" id="OMF.c65.s6">It bore him down with a dread unchanging monotony, in which there was not a moment's variety.</s> <s sid="7" id="OMF.c65.s7">The overweighted beast of burden, or the overweighted slave, can for certain instants shift the physical load, and find some slight respite even in enforcing additional pain upon such a set of muscles or such a limb.</s> <s sid="8" id="OMF.c65.s8">Not even that poor mockery of relief could the wretched man obtain, under the steady pressure of the infernal atmosphere into which he had entered.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="OMF.c66.p1"><s sid="1" id="OMF.c66.s1">Mr and Mrs John Harmon's first delightful occupation was, to set all matters right that had strayed in any way wrong, or that might, could, would, or should, have strayed in any way wrong, while their name was in abeyance.</s> <s sid="2" id="OMF.c66.s2">In tracing out affairs for which John's fictitious death was to be considered in any way responsible, they used a very broad and free construction; regarding, for instance, the dolls' dressmaker as having a claim on their protection, because of her association with Mrs Eugene Wrayburn, and because of Mrs Eugene's old association, in her turn, with the dark side of the story.</s> <s sid="3" id="OMF.c66.s3">It followed that the old man, Riah, as a good and serviceable friend to both, was not to be disclaimed.</s> <s sid="4" id="OMF.c66.s4">Nor even Mr Inspector, as having been trepanned into an industrious hunt on a false scent.</s> <s sid="5" id="OMF.c66.s5">It may be remarked, in connexion with that worthy officer, that a rumour shortly afterwards pervaded the Force, to the effect that he had confided to Miss Abbey Potterson, over a jug of mellow flip in the bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, that he 'didn't stand to lose a farthing' through Mr Harmon's coming to life, but was quite as well satisfied as if that gentleman had been barbarously murdered, and he (Mr Inspector) had pocketed the government reward.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OMF.c66.p2"><s sid="6" id="OMF.c66.s6">In all their arrangements of such nature, Mr and Mrs John Harmon derived much assistance from their eminent solicitor, Mr Mortimer Lightwood; who laid about him professionally with such unwonted despatch and intention, that a piece of work was vigorously pursued as soon as cut out; whereby Young Blight was acted on as by that transatlantic dram which is poetically named An Eye- Opener, and found himself staring at real clients instead of out of window.</s> <s sid="7" id="OMF.c66.s7">The accessibility of Riah proving very useful as to a few hints towards the disentanglement of Eugene's affairs, Lightwood applied himself with infinite zest to attacking and harassing Mr Fledgeby: who, discovering himself in danger of being blown into the air by certain explosive transactions in which he had been engaged, and having been sufficiently flayed under his beating, came to a parley and asked for quarter.</s> <s sid="8" id="OMF.c66.s8">The harmless Twemlow profited by the conditions entered into, though he little thought it.</s> <s sid="9" id="OMF.c66.s9">Mr Riah unaccountably melted; waited in person on him over the stable yard in Duke Street, St James's, no longer ravening but mild, to inform him that payment of interest as heretofore, but henceforth at Mr Lightwood's offices, would appease his Jewish rancour; and departed with the secret that Mr John Harmon had advanced the money and become the creditor.</s> <s sid="10" id="OMF.c66.s10">Thus, was the sublime Snigsworth's wrath averted, and thus did he snort no larger amount of moral grandeur at the Corinthian column in the print over the fireplace, than was normally in his (and the British) constitution.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OMF.c66.p3"><s sid="11" id="OMF.c66.s11">Mrs Wilfer's first visit to the Mendicant's bride at the new abode of Mendicancy, was a grand event.</s> <s sid="12" id="OMF.c66.s12">Pa had been sent for into the City, on the very day of taking possession, and had been stunned with astonishment, and brought-to, and led about the house by one ear, to behold its various treasures, and had been enraptured and enchanted.</s> <s sid="13" id="OMF.c66.s13">Pa had also been appointed Secretary, and had been enjoined to give instant notice of resignation to Chicksey, Veneering, and Stobbles, for ever and ever.</s> <s sid="14" id="OMF.c66.s14">But Ma came later, and came, as was her due, in state.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OMF.c66.p4" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="OMF.c66.s15">The carriage was sent for Ma, who entered it with a bearing worthy of the occasion, accompanied, rather than supported, by Miss Lavinia, who altogether declined to recognize the maternal majesty.</s> <s sid="16" id="OMF.c66.s16">Mr George Sampson meekly followed.</s> <s sid="17" id="OMF.c66.s17">He was received in the vehicle, by Mrs Wilfer, as if admitted to the honour of assisting at a funeral in the family, and she then issued the order, <qs/>'Onward!'<qe/> to the Mendicant's menial.</s> </p><p pid="5" id="OMF.c66.p5"

id="OMF.c66.s24">But why one should go out to dine with one's own daughter or sister, as if one's under-petticoat was a blackboard, I do NOT understand.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="10" id="OMF.c66.p10" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="OMF.c66.s25"><qs/>'Neither do I understand,'<qe/><sls/> retorted Mrs Wilfer, with deep scorn, <sle/><qs/>'how a young lady can mention the garment in the name of which you have indulged.</s> <s sid="26" id="OMF.c66.s26">I blush for you.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="OMF.c66.p11" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="OMF.c66.s27"><qs/>'Thank you, Ma,'<qe/><sss/> said Lavvy,

with the view of establishing harmony, which he never under any circumstances succeeded in doing, said with an agreeable smile:</s> <s sid="29" id="OMF.c66.s29"><qs/>'After all, you know, ma'am, we know it's there.'<qe/></s> <s sid="30" id="OMF.c66.s30">And immediately felt that he had committed himself.</s> </p><p pid="13" id="OMF.c66.p13" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="OMF.c66.s31"><qs/>'We

<sse/><qs/>'I must say that I don't understand your allusions, and that I think you might be more delicate and less personal.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="OMF.c66.p15" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="OMF.c66.s33"><qs/>'Go it!'<qe/> cried Mr Sampson, becoming, on the shortest notice, a prey to despair.</s> <s sid="34" id="OMF.c66.s34"><qs/>'Oh yes!</s> <s sid="35" id="OMF.c66.s35">Go it, Miss

<title>POSTSCRIPT IN LIEU OF PREFACE</title>

<p pid="1" id="OMF.c68.p1"><s sid="1" id="OMF.c68.s1">When I devised this story, I foresaw the likelihood that a class of readers and commentators would suppose that I was at great pains to conceal exactly what I was at great pains to suggest: namely, that Mr John Harmon was not slain, and that Mr John Rokesmith was he.</s> <s sid="2" id="OMF.c68.s2">Pleasing myself with the idea that the supposition might in part arise out of some ingenuity in the story, and thinking it worth while, in the interests of art, to hint to an audience that an artist (of whatever denomination) may perhaps be trusted to know what he is about in his vocation, if they will concede him a little patience, I was not alarmed by the anticipation.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OMF.c68.p2"><s sid="3" id="OMF.c68.s3">To keep for a long time unsuspected, yet always working itself out, another purpose originating in that leading incident, and turning it to a pleasant and useful account at last, was at once the most interesting and the most difficult part of my design.</s> <s sid="4" id="OMF.c68.s4">Its difficulty was much enhanced by the mode of publication; for, it would be very unreasonable to expect that many readers, pursuing a story in portions from month to month through nineteen months, will, until they have it before them complete, perceive the relations of its finer threads to the whole pattern which is always before the eyes of the story-weaver at his loom.</s> <s sid="5" id="OMF.c68.s5">Yet, that I hold the advantages of the mode of publication to outweigh its disadvantages, may be easily believed of one who revived it in the Pickwick Papers after long disuse, and has pursued it ever since.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OMF.c68.p3"><s sid="6" id="OMF.c68.s6">There is sometimes an odd disposition in this country to dispute as improbable in fiction, what are the commonest experiences in fact.</s> <s sid="7" id="OMF.c68.s7">Therefore, I note here, though it may not be at all necessary, that there are hundreds of Will Cases (as they are called), far more remarkable than that fancied in this book; and that the stores of the Prerogative Office teem with instances of testators who have made, changed, contradicted, hidden, forgotten, left cancelled, and left uncancelled, each many more wills than were ever made by the elder Mr Harmon of Harmony Jail.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OMF.c68.p4"><s sid="8" id="OMF.c68.s8">In my social experiences since Mrs Betty Higden came upon the scene and left it, I have found Circumlocutional champions disposed to be warm with me on the subject of my view of the Poor Law.</s> <s sid="9" id="OMF.c68.s9">Mr friend Mr Bounderby could never see any difference between leaving the Coketown 'hands' exactly as they were, and requiring them to be fed with turtle soup and venison out of gold spoons.</s> <s sid="10" id="OMF.c68.s10">Idiotic propositions of a parallel nature have been freely offered for my acceptance, and I have been called upon to admit that I would give Poor Law relief to anybody, anywhere, anyhow.</s> <s sid="11" id="OMF.c68.s11">Putting this nonsense aside, I have observed a suspicious tendency in the champions to divide into two parties; the one, contending that there are no deserving Poor who prefer death by slow starvation and bitter weather, to the mercies of some Relieving Officers and some Union Houses; the other, admitting that there are such Poor, but denying that they have any cause or reason for what they do.</s> <s sid="12" id="OMF.c68.s12">The records in our newspapers, the late exposure by THE LANCET, and the common sense and senses of common people, furnish too abundant evidence against both defences.</s> <s sid="13" id="OMF.c68.s13">But, that my view of the Poor Law may not be mistaken or misrepresented, I will state it.</s> <s sid="14" id="OMF.c68.s14">I believe there has been in England, since the days of the STUARTS, no law so often infamously administered, no law so often openly violated, no law habitually so ill-supervised.</s> <s sid="15" id="OMF.c68.s15">In the majority of the shameful cases of disease and death from destitution, that shock the Public and disgrace the country, the illegality is quite equal to the inhumanity--and known language could say no more of their lawlessness.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="OMF.c68.p5"><s sid="16" id="OMF.c68.s16">On Friday the Ninth of June in the present year, Mr and Mrs Boffin (in their manuscript dress of receiving Mr and Mrs Lammle at breakfast) were on the South Eastern Railway with me, in a terribly destructive accident.</s> <s sid="17" id="OMF.c68.s17">When I had done what I could to help others, I climbed back into my carriage--nearly turned over a viaduct, and caught aslant upon the turn--to extricate the worthy couple.</s> <s sid="18" id="OMF.c68.s18">They were much soiled, but otherwise unhurt.</s> <s sid="19" id="OMF.c68.s19">The same happy result attended Miss Bella Wilfer on her wedding day, and Mr Riderhood inspecting Bradley Headstone's red neckerchief as he lay asleep.</s> <s sid="20" id="OMF.c68.s20">I remember with devout thankfulness that I can never be much nearer parting company with my readers for ever, than I was then, until there shall be written against my life, the two words with which I have this day closed this book:--THE END.</s> </p>
