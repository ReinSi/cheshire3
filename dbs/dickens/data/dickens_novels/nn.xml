<stru>THE LIFE AND ADVENTURES OF NICHOLAS NICKLEBY,

containing a Faithful Account of the Fortunes, Misfortunes,

Uprisings, Downfallings and Complete Career of the Nickelby Family



by Charles Dickens</stru>









<stru>AUTHOR'S PREFACE





This story was begun, within a few months after the publication of

the completed "Pickwick Papers."  There were, then, a good many cheap

Yorkshire schools in existence.  There are very few now.



Of the monstrous neglect of education in England, and the disregard

of it by the State as a means of forming good or bad citizens, and

miserable or happy men, private schools long afforded a notable

example.  Although any man who had proved his unfitness for any other

occupation in life, was free, without examination or qualification,

to open a school anywhere; although preparation for the functions he

undertook, was required in the surgeon who assisted to bring a boy

into the world, or might one day assist, perhaps, to send him out of

it; in the chemist, the attorney, the butcher, the baker, the

candlestick maker; the whole round of crafts and trades, the

schoolmaster excepted; and although schoolmasters, as a race, were

the blockheads and impostors who might naturally be expected to

spring from such a state of things, and to flourish in it; these

Yorkshire schoolmasters were the lowest and most rotten round in the

whole ladder.  Traders in the avarice, indifference, or imbecility of

parents, and the helplessness of children; ignorant, sordid, brutal

men, to whom few considerate persons would have entrusted the board

and lodging of a horse or a dog; they formed the worthy cornerstone

of a structure, which, for absurdity and a magnificent high-minded

LAISSEZ-ALLER neglect, has rarely been exceeded in the world.



We hear sometimes of an action for damages against the unqualified

medical practitioner, who has deformed a broken limb in pretending to

heal it.  But, what of the hundreds of thousands of minds that have

been deformed for ever by the incapable pettifoggers who have

pretended to form them!



I make mention of the race, as of the Yorkshire schoolmasters, in the

past tense.  Though it has not yet finally disappeared, it is

dwindling daily.  A long day's work remains to be done about us in

the way of education, Heaven knows; but great improvements and

facilities towards the attainment of a good one, have been furnished,

of late years.



I cannot call to mind, now, how I came to hear about Yorkshire

schools when I was a not very robust child, sitting in bye-places

near Rochester Castle, with a head full of PARTRIDGE, STRAP, TOM

PIPES, and SANCHO PANZA; but I know that my first impressions of them

were picked up at that time, and that they were somehow or other

connected with a suppurated abscess that some boy had come home with,

in consequence of his Yorkshire guide, philosopher, and friend,

having ripped it open with an inky pen-knife.  The impression made

upon me, however made, never left me.  I was always curious about

Yorkshire schools--fell, long afterwards and at sundry times, into

the way of hearing more about them--at last, having an audience,

resolved to write about them.



With that intent I went down into Yorkshire before I began this book,

in very severe winter time which is pretty faithfully described

herein.  As I wanted to see a schoolmaster or two, and was forewarned

that those gentlemen might, in their modesty, be shy of receiving a

visit from the author of the "Pickwick Papers," I consulted with a

professional friend who had a Yorkshire connexion, and with whom I

concerted a pious fraud.  He gave me some letters of introduction, in

the name, I think, of my travelling companion; they bore reference to

a supposititious little boy who had been left with a widowed mother

who didn't know what to do with him; the poor lady had thought, as a

means of thawing the tardy compassion of her relations in his behalf,

of sending him to a Yorkshire school; I was the poor lady's friend,

travelling that way; and if the recipient of the letter could inform

me of a school in his neighbourhood, the writer would be very much

obliged.



I went to several places in that part of the country where I

understood the schools to be most plentifully sprinkled, and had no

occasion to deliver a letter until I came to a certain town which

shall be nameless.  The person to whom it was addressed, was not at

home; but he came down at night, through the snow, to the inn where I

was staying.  It was after dinner; and he needed little persuasion to

sit down by the fire in a warrn corner, and take his share of the

wine that was on the table.



I am afraid he is dead now.  I recollect he was a jovial, ruddy,

broad-faced man; that we got acquainted directly; and that we talked

on all kinds of subjects, except the school, which he showed a great

anxiety to avoid.  "Was there any large school near?" I asked him, in

reference to the letter.  "Oh yes," he said; "there was a pratty big

'un."  "Was it a good one?" I asked.  "Ey!" he said, "it was as good

as anoother; that was a' a matther of opinion"; and fell to looking

at the fire, staring round the room, and whistling a little.  On my

reverting to some other topic that we had been discussing, he

recovered immediately; but, though I tried him again and again, I

never approached the question of the school, even if he were in the

middle of a laugh, without observing that his countenance fell, and

that he became uncomfortable.  At last, when we had passed a couple

of hours or so, very agreeably, he suddenly took up his hat, and

leaning over the table and looking me full in the face, said, in a

low voice: "Weel, Misther, we've been vara pleasant toogather, and

ar'll spak' my moind tiv'ee.  Dinnot let the weedur send her lattle

boy to yan o' our school-measthers, while there's a harse to hoold in

a' Lunnun, or a gootther to lie asleep in.  Ar wouldn't mak' ill

words amang my neeburs, and ar speak tiv'ee quiet loike.  But I'm

dom'd if ar can gang to bed and not tellee, for weedur's sak', to

keep the lattle boy from a' sike scoondrels while there's a harse to

hoold in a' Lunnun, or a gootther to lie asleep in!"  Repeating these

words with great heartiness, and with a solemnity on his jolly face

that made it look twice as large as before, he shook hands and went

away.  I never saw him afterwards, but I sometimes imagine that I

descry a faint reflection of him in John Browdie.



In reference to these gentry, I may here quote a few words from the

original preface to this book.



"It has afforded the Author great amusement and satisfaction, during

the progress of this work, to learn, from country friends and from a

variety of ludicrous statements concerning himself in provincial

newspapers, that more than one Yorkshire schoolmaster lays claim to

being the original of Mr. Squeers.  One worthy, he has reason to

believe, has actually consulted authorities learned in the law, as to

his having good grounds on which to rest an action for libel;

another, has meditated a journey to London, for the express purpose

of committing an assault and battery on his traducer; a third,

perfectly remembers being waited on, last January twelve-month, by

two gentlemen, one of whom held him in conversation while the other

took his likeness; and, although Mr. Squeers has but one eye, and he

has two, and the published sketch does not resemble him (whoever he

may be) in any other respect, still he and all his friends and

neighbours know at once for whom it is meant, because--the character

is SO like him.



"While the Author cannot but feel the full force of the compliment

thus conveyed to him, he ventures to suggest that these contentions

may arise from the fact, that Mr. Squeers is the representative of a

class, and not of an individual.  Where imposture, ignorance, and

brutal cupidity, are the stock in trade of a small body of men, and

one is described by these characteristics, all his fellows will

recognise something belonging to themselves, and each will have a

misgiving that the portrait is his own.



'The Author's object in calling public attention to the system would

be very imperfectly fulfilled, if he did not state now, in his own

person, emphatically and earnestly, that Mr. Squeers and his school

are faint and feeble pictures of an existing reality, purposely

subdued and kept down lest they should be deemed impossible.  That

there are, upon record, trials at law in which damages have been

sought as a poor recompense for lasting agonies and disfigurements

inflicted upon children by the treatment of the master in these

places, involving such offensive and foul details of neglect,

cruelty, and disease, as no writer of fiction would have the boldness

to imagine.  And that, since he has been engaged upon these

Adventures, he has received, from private quarters far beyond the

reach of suspicion or distrust, accounts of atrocities, in the

perpetration of which upon neglected or repudiated children, these

schools have been the main instruments, very far exceeding any that

appear in these pages."



This comprises all I need say on the subject; except that if I had

seen occasion, I had resolved to reprint a few of these details of

legal proceedings, from certain old newspapers.



One other quotation from the same Preface may serve to introduce a

fact that my readers may think curious.



"To turn to a more pleasant subject, it may be right to say, that

there ARE two characters in this book which are drawn from life.  It

is remarkable that what we call the world, which is so very credulous

in what professes to be true, is most incredulous in what professes

to be imaginary; and that, while, every day in real life, it will

allow in one man no blemishes, and in another no virtues, it will

seldom admit a very strongly-marked character, either good or bad, in

a fictitious narrative, to be within the limits of probability.  But

those who take an interest in this tale, will be glad to learn that

the BROTHERS CHEERYBLE live; that their liberal charity, their

singleness of heart, their noble nature, and their unbounded

benevolence, are no creations of the Author's brain; but are

prompting every day (and oftenest by stealth) some munificent and

generous deed in that town of which they are the pride and honour."



If I were to attempt to sum up the thousands of letters, from all

sorts of people in all sorts of latitudes and climates, which this

unlucky paragraph brought down upon me, I should get into an

arithmetical difficulty from which I could not easily extricate

myself.  Suffice it to say, that I believe the applications for

loans, gifts, and offices of profit that I have been requested to

forward to the originals of the BROTHERS CHEERYBLE (with whom I never

interchanged any communication in my life) would have exhausted the

combined patronage of all the Lord Chancellors since the accession of

the House of Brunswick, and would have broken the Rest of the Bank of

England.



The Brothers are now dead.



There is only one other point, on which I would desire to offer a

remark.  If Nicholas be not always found to be blameless or

agreeable, he is not always intended to appear so.  He is a young man

of an impetuous temper and of little or no experience; and I saw no

reason why such a hero should be lifted out of nature.</stru>

<title>CHAPTER 1 Introduces all the Rest</title>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c1.s1">There once lived, in a sequestered part of the county of Devonshire, one Mr Godfrey Nickleby: a worthy gentleman, who, taking it into his head rather late in life that he must get married, and not being young enough or rich enough to aspire to the hand of a lady of fortune, had wedded an old flame out of mere attachment, who in her turn had taken him for the same reason.</s> <s sid="2" id="NN.c1.s2">Thus two people who cannot afford to play cards for money, sometimes sit down to a quiet game for love.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c1.p2"><s sid="3" id="NN.c1.s3">Some ill-conditioned persons who sneer at the life-matrimonial, may perhaps suggest, in this place, that the good couple would be better likened to two principals in a sparring match, who, when fortune is low and backers scarce, will chivalrously set to, for the mere pleasure of the buffeting; and in one respect indeed this comparison would hold good; for, as the adventurous pair of the Fives' Court will afterwards send round a hat, and trust to the bounty of the lookers-on for the means of regaling themselves, so Mr Godfrey Nickleby and HIS partner, the honeymoon being over, looked out wistfully into the world, relying in no inconsiderable degree upon chance for the improvement of their means.</s> <s sid="4" id="NN.c1.s4">Mr Nickleby's income, at the period of his marriage, fluctuated between sixty and eighty pounds PER ANNUM.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="NN.c1.p3"><s sid="5" id="NN.c1.s5">There are people enough in the world, Heaven knows! and even in London (where Mr Nickleby dwelt in those days) but few complaints prevail, of the population being scanty.</s> <s sid="6" id="NN.c1.s6">It is extraordinary how long a man may look among the crowd without discovering the face of a friend, but it is no less true.</s> <s sid="7" id="NN.c1.s7">Mr Nickleby looked, and looked, till his eyes became sore as his heart, but no friend appeared; and when, growing tired of the search, he turned his eyes homeward, he saw very little there to relieve his weary vision.</s> <s sid="8" id="NN.c1.s8">A painter who has gazed too long upon some glaring colour, refreshes his dazzled sight by looking upon a darker and more sombre tint; but everything that met Mr Nickleby's gaze wore so black and gloomy a hue, that he would have been beyond description refreshed by the very reverse of the contrast.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="NN.c1.p4"><s sid="9" id="NN.c1.s9">At length, after five years, when Mrs Nickleby had presented her husband with a couple of sons, and that embarassed gentleman, impressed with the necessity of making some provision for his family, was seriously revolving in his mind a little commercial speculation of insuring his life next quarter-day, and then falling from the top of the Monument by accident, there came, one morning, by the general post, a black-bordered letter to inform him how his uncle, Mr Ralph Nickleby, was dead, and had left him the bulk of his little property, amounting in all to five thousand pounds sterling.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="NN.c1.p5"><s sid="10" id="NN.c1.s10">As the deceased had taken no further notice of his nephew in his lifetime, than sending to his eldest boy (who had been christened after him, on desperate speculation) a silver spoon in a morocco case, which, as he had not too much to eat with it, seemed a kind of satire upon his having been born without that useful article of plate in his mouth, Mr Godfrey Nickleby could, at first, scarcely believe the tidings thus conveyed to him.</s> <s sid="11" id="NN.c1.s11">On examination, however, they turned out to be strictly correct.</s> <s sid="12" id="NN.c1.s12">The amiable old gentleman, it seemed, had intended to leave the whole to the Royal Humane Society, and had indeed executed a will to that effect; but the Institution, having been unfortunate enough, a few months before, to save the life of a poor relation to whom he paid a weekly allowance of three shillings and sixpence, he had, in a fit of very natural exasperation, revoked the bequest in a codicil, and left it all to Mr Godfrey Nickleby; with a special mention of his indignation, not only against the society for saving the poor relation's life, but against the poor relation also, for allowing himself to be saved.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NN.c1.p6"><s sid="13" id="NN.c1.s13">With a portion of this property Mr Godfrey Nickleby purchased a small farm, near Dawlish in Devonshire, whither he retired with his wife and two children, to live upon the best interest he could get for the rest of his money, and the little produce he could raise from his land.</s> <s sid="14" id="NN.c1.s14">The two prospered so well together that, when he died, some fifteen years after this period, and some five after his wife, he was enabled to leave, to his eldest son, Ralph, three thousand pounds in cash, and to his youngest son, Nicholas, one thousand and the farm, which was as small a landed estate as one would desire to see.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="NN.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="NN.c1.s15">These two brothers had been brought up together in a school at Exeter; and, being accustomed to go home once a week, had often heard, from their mother's lips, long accounts of their father's sufferings in his days of poverty, and of their deceased uncle's importance in his days of affluence: which recitals produced a very different impression on the two: for, while the younger, who was of a timid and retiring disposition, gleaned from thence nothing but forewarnings to shun the great world and attach himself to the quiet routine of a country life, Ralph, the elder, deduced from the often- repeated tale the two great morals that riches are the only true source of happiness and power, and that it is lawful and just to compass their acquisition by all means short of felony.</s> <s sid="16" id="NN.c1.s16"><qs/>'And,'<qe/><sss/> reasoned Ralph with himself, <sse/><qs/>'if no good came of my uncle's money when he was alive, a great deal of good came of it after he was dead, inasmuch as my father has got it now, and is saving it up for me, which is a highly virtuous purpose; and, going back to the old gentleman, good DID come of it to him too, for he had the pleasure of thinking of it all his life long, and of being envied and courted by all his family besides.'<qe/></s> <s sid="17" id="NN.c1.s17">And Ralph always wound up these mental soliloquies by arriving at the conclusion, that there was nothing like money.</s> </p><p pid="8" id="NN.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="NN.c1.s18">Not confining himself to theory, or permitting his faculties to rust, even at that early age, in mere abstract speculations, this promising lad commenced usurer on a limited scale at school; putting out at good interest a small capital of slate-pencil and marbles, and gradually extending his operations until they aspired to the copper coinage of this realm, in which he speculated to considerable advantage.</s> <s sid="19" id="NN.c1.s19">Nor did he trouble his borrowers with abstract calculations of figures, or references to ready-reckoners; his simple rule of interest being all comprised in the one golden sentence, <qs/>'two-pence for every half-penny,'<qe/> which greatly simplified the accounts, and which, as a familiar precept, more easily acquired and retained in the memory than any known rule of arithmetic, cannot be too strongly recommended to the notice of capitalists, both large and small, and more especially of money-brokers and bill- discounters.</s> <s sid="20" id="NN.c1.s20">Indeed, to do these gentlemen justice, many of them are to this day in the frequent habit of adopting it, with eminent success.</s> </p><p pid="9" id="NN.c1.p9"><s sid="21" id="NN.c1.s21">In like manner, did young Ralph Nickleby avoid all those minute and intricate calculations of odd days, which nobody who has worked sums in simple-interest can fail to have found most embarrassing, by establishing the one general rule that all sums of principal and interest should be paid on pocket-money day, that is to say, on Saturday: and that whether a loan were contracted on the Monday, or on the Friday, the amount of interest should be, in both cases, the same.</s> <s sid="22" id="NN.c1.s22">Indeed he argued, and with great show of reason, that it ought to be rather more for one day than for five, inasmuch as the borrower might in the former case be very fairly presumed to be in great extremity, otherwise he would not borrow at all with such odds against him.</s> <s sid="23" id="NN.c1.s23">This fact is interesting, as illustrating the secret connection and sympathy which always exist between great minds.</s> <s sid="24" id="NN.c1.s24">Though Master Ralph Nickleby was not at that time aware of it, the class of gentlemen before alluded to, proceed on just the same principle in all their transactions.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="NN.c1.p10"><s sid="25" id="NN.c1.s25">From what we have said of this young gentleman, and the natural admiration the reader will immediately conceive of his character, it may perhaps be inferred that he is to be the hero of the work which we shall presently begin.</s> <s sid="26" id="NN.c1.s26">To set this point at rest, for once and for ever, we hasten to undeceive them, and stride to its commencement.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="NN.c1.p11"><s sid="27" id="NN.c1.s27">On the death of his father, Ralph Nickleby, who had been some time before placed in a mercantile house in London, applied himself passionately to his old pursuit of money-getting, in which he speedily became so buried and absorbed, that he quite forgot his brother for many years; and if, at times, a recollection of his old playfellow broke upon him through the haze in which he lived--for gold conjures up a mist about a man, more destructive of all his old senses and lulling to his feelings than the fumes of charcoal--it brought along with it a companion thought, that if they were intimate he would want to borrow money of him.</s> <s sid="28" id="NN.c1.s28">So, Mr Ralph Nickleby shrugged his shoulders, and said things were better as they were.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="NN.c1.p12"><s sid="29" id="NN.c1.s29">As for Nicholas, he lived a single man on the patrimonial estate until he grew tired of living alone, and then he took to wife the daughter of a neighbouring gentleman with a dower of one thousand pounds.</s> <s sid="30" id="NN.c1.s30">This good lady bore him two children, a son and a daughter, and when the son was about nineteen, and the daughter fourteen, as near as we can guess--impartial records of young ladies' ages being, before the passing of the new act, nowhere preserved in the registries of this country--Mr Nickleby looked about him for the means of repairing his capital, now sadly reduced by this increase in his family, and the expenses of their education.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c2.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="NN.c2.s1">Mr Ralph Nickleby was not, strictly speaking, what you would call a merchant, neither was he a banker, nor an attorney, nor a special pleader, nor a notary.</s> <s sid="2" id="NN.c2.s2">He was certainly not a tradesman, and still less could he lay any claim to the title of a professional gentleman; for it would have been impossible to mention any recognised profession to which he belonged.</s> <s sid="3" id="NN.c2.s3">Nevertheless, as he lived in a spacious house in Golden Square, which, in addition to a brass plate upon the street-door, had another brass plate two sizes and a half smaller upon the left hand door-post, surrounding a brass model of an infant's fist grasping a fragment of a skewer, and displaying the word <qs/>'Office,'<qe/> it was clear that Mr Ralph Nickleby did, or pretended to do, business of some kind; and the fact, if it required any further circumstantial evidence, was abundantly demonstrated by the diurnal attendance, between the hours of half- past nine and five, of a sallow-faced man in rusty brown, who sat upon an uncommonly hard stool in a species of butler's pantry at the end of the passage, and always had a pen behind his ear when he answered the bell.</s> </p><p pid="2" id="NN.c2.p2"><s sid="4" id="NN.c2.s4">Although a few members of the graver professions live about Golden Square, it is not exactly in anybody's way to or from anywhere.</s> <s sid="5" id="NN.c2.s5">It is one of the squares that have been; a quarter of the town that has gone down in the world, and taken to letting lodgings.</s> <s sid="6" id="NN.c2.s6">Many of its first and second floors are let, furnished, to single gentlemen; and it takes boarders besides.</s> <s sid="7" id="NN.c2.s7">It is a great resort of foreigners.</s> <s sid="8" id="NN.c2.s8">The dark-complexioned men who wear large rings, and heavy watch-guards, and bushy whiskers, and who congregate under the Opera Colonnade, and about the box-office in the season, between four and five in the afternoon, when they give away the orders,--all live in Golden Square, or within a street of it.</s> <s sid="9" id="NN.c2.s9">Two or three violins and a wind instrument from the Opera band reside within its precincts.</s> <s sid="10" id="NN.c2.s10">Its boarding-houses are musical, and the notes of pianos and harps float in the evening time round the head of the mournful statue, the guardian genius of a little wilderness of shrubs, in the centre of the square.</s> <s sid="11" id="NN.c2.s11">On a summer's night, windows are thrown open, and groups of swarthy moustached men are seen by the passer-by, lounging at the casements, and smoking fearfully.</s> <s sid="12" id="NN.c2.s12">Sounds of gruff voices practising vocal music invade the evening's silence; and the fumes of choice tobacco scent the air.</s> <s sid="13" id="NN.c2.s13">There, snuff and cigars, and German pipes and flutes, and violins and violoncellos, divide the supremacy between them.</s> <s sid="14" id="NN.c2.s14">It is the region of song and smoke.</s> <s sid="15" id="NN.c2.s15">Street bands are on their mettle in Golden Square; and itinerant glee- singers quaver involuntarily as they raise their voices within its boundaries.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="NN.c2.p3"><s sid="16" id="NN.c2.s16">This would not seem a spot very well adapted to the transaction of business; but Mr Ralph Nickleby had lived there, notwithstanding, for many years, and uttered no complaint on that score.</s> <s sid="17" id="NN.c2.s17">He knew nobody round about, and nobody knew him, although he enjoyed the reputation of being immensely rich.</s> <s sid="18" id="NN.c2.s18">The tradesmen held that he was a sort of lawyer, and the other neighbours opined that he was a kind of general agent; both of which guesses were as correct and definite as guesses about other people's affairs usually are, or need to be.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="NN.c2.p4"><s sid="19" id="NN.c2.s19">Mr Ralph Nickleby sat in his private office one morning, ready dressed to walk abroad.</s> <s sid="20" id="NN.c2.s20">He wore a bottle-green spencer over a blue coat; a white waistcoat, grey mixture pantaloons, and Wellington boots drawn over them.</s> <s sid="21" id="NN.c2.s21">The corner of a small-plaited shirt-frill struggled out, as if insisting to show itself, from between his chin and the top button of his spencer; and the latter garment was not made low enough to conceal a long gold watch-chain, composed of a series of plain rings, which had its beginning at the handle of a gold repeater in Mr Nickleby's pocket, and its termination in two little keys: one belonging to the watch itself, and the other to some patent padlock.</s> <s sid="22" id="NN.c2.s22">He wore a sprinkling of powder upon his head, as if to make himself look benevolent; but if that were his purpose, he would perhaps have done better to powder his countenance also, for there was something in its very wrinkles, and in his cold restless eye, which seemed to tell of cunning that would announce itself in spite of him.</s> <s sid="23" id="NN.c2.s23">However this might be, there he was; and as he was all alone, neither the powder, nor the wrinkles, nor the eyes, had the smallest effect, good or bad, upon anybody just then, and are consequently no business of ours just now.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="NN.c2.p5"><s sid="24" id="NN.c2.s24">Mr Nickleby closed an account-book which lay on his desk, and, throwing himself back in his chair, gazed with an air of abstraction through the dirty window.</s> <s sid="25" id="NN.c2.s25">Some London houses have a melancholy little plot of ground behind them, usually fenced in by four high whitewashed walls, and frowned upon by stacks of chimneys: in which there withers on, from year to year, a crippled tree, that makes a show of putting forth a few leaves late in autumn when other trees shed theirs, and, drooping in the effort, lingers on, all crackled and smoke-dried, till the following season, when it repeats the same process, and perhaps, if the weather be particularly genial, even tempts some rheumatic sparrow to chirrup in its branches.</s> <s sid="26" id="NN.c2.s26">People sometimes call these dark yards 'gardens'; it is not supposed that they were ever planted, but rather that they are pieces of unreclaimed land, with the withered vegetation of the original brick-field.</s> <s sid="27" id="NN.c2.s27">No man thinks of walking in this desolate place, or of turning it to any account.</s> <s sid="28" id="NN.c2.s28">A few hampers, half-a-dozen broken bottles, and such-like rubbish, may be thrown there, when the tenant first moves in, but nothing more; and there they remain until he goes away again: the damp straw taking just as long to moulder as it thinks proper: and mingling with the scanty box, and stunted everbrowns, and broken flower-pots, that are scattered mournfully about--a prey to 'blacks' and dirt.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NN.c2.p6"><s sid="29" id="NN.c2.s29">It was into a place of this kind that Mr Ralph Nickleby gazed, as he sat with his hands in his pockets looking out of the window.</s> <s sid="30" id="NN.c2.s30">He had fixed his eyes upon a distorted fir tree, planted by some former tenant in a tub that had once been green, and left there, years before, to rot away piecemeal.</s> <s sid="31" id="NN.c2.s31">There was nothing very inviting in the object, but Mr Nickleby was wrapt in a brown study, and sat contemplating it with far greater attention than, in a more conscious mood, he would have deigned to bestow upon the rarest exotic.</s> <s sid="32" id="NN.c2.s32">At length, his eyes wandered to a little dirty window on the left, through which the face of the clerk was dimly visible; that worthy chancing to look up, he beckoned him to attend.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="NN.c2.p7"><s sid="33" id="NN.c2.s33">In obedience to this summons the clerk got off the high stool (to which he had communicated a high polish by countless gettings off and on), and presented himself in Mr Nickleby's room.</s> <s sid="34" id="NN.c2.s34">He was a tall man of middle age, with two goggle eyes whereof one was a fixture, a rubicund nose, a cadaverous face, and a suit of clothes (if the term be allowable when they suited him not at all) much the worse for wear, very much too small, and placed upon such a short allowance of buttons that it was marvellous how he contrived to keep them on.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="NN.c2.p8" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="NN.c2.s35"><qs/>'Was that half-past twelve, Noggs?'<qe/> said Mr Nickleby, in a sharp and grating voice.</s> </p><p pid="9" id="NN.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="36" id="NN.c2.s36"><qs/>'Not more than five-and-twenty minutes by the--' Noggs was going to add public-house clock, but recollecting himself, substituted 'regular time.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="10" id="NN.c2.p10" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="NN.c2.s37"><qs/>'My watch has stopped,'<qe/><sss/> said Mr Nickleby; <sse/><qs/>'I don't know from what cause.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="NN.c2.p11" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="NN.c2.s38"><qs/>'Not wound up,'<qe/> said Noggs.</s> </p><p pid="12" id="NN.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="NN.c2.s39"><qs/>'Yes it is,'<qe/> said Mr Nickleby.</s> </p><p pid="13" id="NN.c2.p13" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="NN.c2.s40"><qs/>'Over-wound then,'<qe/> rejoined Noggs.</s> </p><p pid="14" id="NN.c2.p14" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="NN.c2.s41"><qs/>'That can't very well be,'<qe/> observed Mr Nickleby.</s> </p><p pid="15" id="NN.c2.p15" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="NN.c2.s42"><qs/>'Must be,'<qe/> said Noggs.</s> </p><p pid="16" id="NN.c2.p16" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="NN.c2.s43"><qs/>'Well!'<qe/><sls/> said Mr Nickleby, putting the repeater back in his pocket; <sle/><qs/>'perhaps it is.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="17" id="NN.c2.p17"><s sid="44" id="NN.c2.s44">Noggs gave a peculiar grunt, as was his custom at the end of all disputes with his master, to imply that he (Noggs) triumphed; and (as he rarely spoke to anybody unless somebody spoke to him) fell into a grim silence, and rubbed his hands slowly over each other: cracking the joints of his fingers, and squeezing them into all possible distortions.</s> <s sid="45" id="NN.c2.s45">The incessant performance of this routine on every occasion, and the communication of a fixed and rigid look to his unaffected eye, so as to make it uniform with the other, and to render it impossible for anybody to determine where or at what he was looking, were two among the numerous peculiarities of Mr Noggs, which struck an inexperienced observer at first sight.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="NN.c2.p18" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="NN.c2.s46"><qs/>'I am going to the London Tavern this morning,'<qe/> said Mr Nickleby.</s> </p><p pid="19" id="NN.c2.p19" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="NN.c2.s47"><qs/>'Public meeting?'<qe/> inquired Noggs.</s> </p><p pid="20" id="NN.c2.p20"><s sid="48" id="NN.c2.s48">Mr Nickleby nodded.</s> <s sid="49" id="NN.c2.s49">'I expect a letter from the solicitor respecting that mortgage of Ruddle's.</s> <s sid="50" id="NN.c2.s50">If it comes at all, it will be here by the two o'clock delivery.</s> <s sid="51" id="NN.c2.s51">I shall leave the city about that time and walk to Charing Cross on the left-hand side of the way; if there are any letters, come and meet me, and bring them with you.'</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="NN.c2.p21"><s sid="52" id="NN.c2.s52">Noggs nodded; and as he nodded, there came a ring at the office bell.</s> <s sid="53" id="NN.c2.s53">The master looked up from his papers, and the clerk calmly remained in a stationary position.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="NN.c2.p22" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="NN.c2.s54"><qs/>'The bell,'<qe/> said Noggs, as though in explanation.</s> <s sid="55" id="NN.c2.s55"><qs/>'At home?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="NN.c2.p23" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="NN.c2.s56"><qs/>'Yes.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="24" id="NN.c2.p24" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="NN.c2.s57"><qs/>'To anybody?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="NN.c2.p25" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="NN.c2.s58"><qs/>'Yes.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="26" id="NN.c2.p26" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="NN.c2.s59"><qs/>'To the tax-gatherer?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="27" id="NN.c2.p27" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="NN.c2.s60"><qs/>'No!</s> <s sid="61" id="NN.c2.s61">Let him call again.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="28" id="NN.c2.p28" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="NN.c2.s62">Noggs gave vent to his usual grunt, as much as to say <qs/>'I thought so!'<qe/> and, the ring being repeated, went to the door, whence he presently returned, ushering in, by the name of Mr Bonney, a pale gentleman in a violent hurry, who, with his hair standing up in great disorder all over his head, and a very narrow white cravat tied loosely round his throat, looked as if he had been knocked up in the night and had not dressed himself since.</s> </p><p pid="29" id="NN.c2.p29" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="NN.c2.s63"><qs/>'My dear Nickleby,'<qe/><sls/> said the gentleman, taking off a white hat which was so full of papers that it would scarcely stick upon his head, <sle/><qs/>'there's not a moment to lose; I have a cab at the door.</s> <s sid="64" id="NN.c2.s64">Sir Matthew Pupker takes the chair, and three members of Parliament are positively coming.</s> <s sid="65" id="NN.c2.s65">I have seen two of them safely out of bed.</s> <s sid="66" id="NN.c2.s66">The third, who was at Crockford's all night, has just gone home to put a clean shirt on, and take a bottle or two of soda water, and will certainly be with us, in time to address the meeting.</s> <s sid="67" id="NN.c2.s67">He is a little excited by last night, but never mind that; he always speaks the stronger for it.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="30" id="NN.c2.p30" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="NN.c2.s68"><qs/>'It seems to promise pretty well,'<qe/> said Mr Ralph Nickleby, whose deliberate manner was strongly opposed to the vivacity of the other man of business.</s> </p><p pid="31" id="NN.c2.p31" type="speech"><s sid="69" id="NN.c2.s69"><qs/>'Pretty well!'<qe/> echoed Mr Bonney.</s> <s sid="70" id="NN.c2.s70"><qs/>'It's the finest idea that was ever started.</s> <s sid="71" id="NN.c2.s71">"United Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company.</s> <s sid="72" id="NN.c2.s72">Capital, five millions, in five hundred thousand shares of ten pounds each."</s> <s sid="73" id="NN.c2.s73">Why the very name will get the shares up to a premium in ten days.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="32" id="NN.c2.p32" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="NN.c2.s74"><qs/>'And when they ARE at a premium,'<qe/> said Mr Ralph Nickleby, smiling.</s> </p><p pid="33" id="NN.c2.p33" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="NN.c2.s75"><qs/>'When they are, you know what to do with them as well as any man alive, and how to back quietly out at the right time,'<qe/> said Mr Bonney, slapping the capitalist familiarly on the shoulder.</s> <s sid="76" id="NN.c2.s76"><qs/>'By- the-bye, what a VERY remarkable man that clerk of yours is.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="34" id="NN.c2.p34" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="NN.c2.s77"><qs/>'Yes, poor devil!'<qe/> replied Ralph, drawing on his gloves.</s> <s sid="78" id="NN.c2.s78"><qs/>'Though Newman Noggs kept his horses and hounds once.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="35" id="NN.c2.p35" type="speech"><s sid="79" id="NN.c2.s79"><qs/>'Ay, ay?'<qe/> said the other carelessly.</s> </p><p pid="36" id="NN.c2.p36" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="NN.c2.s80"><qs/>'Yes,'<qe/><sss/> continued Ralph, <sse/><qs/>'and not many years ago either; but he squandered his money, invested it anyhow, borrowed at interest, and in short made first a thorough fool of himself, and then a beggar.</s> <s sid="81" id="NN.c2.s81">He took to drinking, and had a touch of paralysis, and then came here to borrow a pound, as in his better days I had--'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="37" id="NN.c2.p37" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="NN.c2.s82"><qs/>'Done business with him,'<qe/> said Mr Bonney with a meaning look.</s> </p><p pid="38" id="NN.c2.p38" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="NN.c2.s83"><qs/>'Just so,'<qe/><sss/> replied Ralph; <sse/><qs/>'I couldn't lend it, you know.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="39" id="NN.c2.p39" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="NN.c2.s84"><qs/>'Oh, of course not.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="40" id="NN.c2.p40" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="NN.c2.s85"><qs/>'But as I wanted a clerk just then, to open the door and so forth, I took him out of charity, and he has remained with me ever since.</s> <s sid="86" id="NN.c2.s86">He is a little mad, I think,'<qe/><sls/> said Mr Nickleby, calling up a charitable look, <sle/><qs/>'but he is useful enough, poor creature--useful enough.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="41" id="NN.c2.p41"><s sid="87" id="NN.c2.s87">The kind-hearted gentleman omitted to add that Newman Noggs, being utterly destitute, served him for rather less than the usual wages of a boy of thirteen; and likewise failed to mention in his hasty chronicle, that his eccentric taciturnity rendered him an especially valuable person in a place where much business was done, of which it was desirable no mention should be made out of doors.</s> <s sid="88" id="NN.c2.s88">The other gentleman was plainly impatient to be gone, however, and as they hurried into the hackney cabriolet immediately afterwards, perhaps Mr Nickleby forgot to mention circumstances so unimportant.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="NN.c2.p42"><s sid="89" id="NN.c2.s89">There was a great bustle in Bishopsgate Street Within, as they drew up, and (it being a windy day) half-a-dozen men were tacking across the road under a press of paper, bearing gigantic announcements that a Public Meeting would be holden at one o'clock precisely, to take into consideration the propriety of petitioning Parliament in favour of the United Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company, capital five millions, in five hundred thousand shares of ten pounds each; which sums were duly set forth in fat black figures of considerable size.</s> <s sid="90" id="NN.c2.s90">Mr Bonney elbowed his way briskly upstairs, receiving in his progress many low bows from the waiters who stood on the landings to show the way; and, followed by Mr Nickleby, dived into a suite of apartments behind the great public room: in the second of which was a business-looking table, and several business-looking people.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="NN.c2.p43" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="NN.c2.s91"><qs/>'Hear!'<qe/> cried a gentleman with a double chin, as Mr Bonney presented himself.</s> <s sid="92" id="NN.c2.s92"><qs/>'Chair, gentlemen, chair!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="44" id="NN.c2.p44" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="NN.c2.s93">The new-comers were received with universal approbation, and Mr Bonney bustled up to the top of the table, took off his hat, ran his fingers through his hair, and knocked a hackney-coachman's knock on the table with a little hammer: whereat several gentlemen cried <qs/>'Hear!'<qe/> and nodded slightly to each other, as much as to say what spirited conduct that was.</s> <s sid="94" id="NN.c2.s94">Just at this moment, a waiter, feverish with agitation, tore into the room, and throwing the door open with a crash, shouted <qs/>'Sir Matthew Pupker!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="45" id="NN.c2.p45"><s sid="95" id="NN.c2.s95">The committee stood up and clapped their hands for joy, and while they were clapping them, in came Sir Matthew Pupker, attended by two live members of Parliament, one Irish and one Scotch, all smiling and bowing, and looking so pleasant that it seemed a perfect marvel how any man could have the heart to vote against them.</s> <s sid="96" id="NN.c2.s96">Sir Matthew Pupker especially, who had a little round head with a flaxen wig on the top of it, fell into such a paroxysm of bows, that the wig threatened to be jerked off, every instant.</s> <s sid="97" id="NN.c2.s97">When these symptoms had in some degree subsided, the gentlemen who were on speaking terms with Sir Matthew Pupker, or the two other members, crowded round them in three little groups, near one or other of which the gentlemen who were NOT on speaking terms with Sir Matthew Pupker or the two other members, stood lingering, and smiling, and rubbing their hands, in the desperate hope of something turning up which might bring them into notice.</s> <s sid="98" id="NN.c2.s98">All this time, Sir Matthew Pupker and the two other members were relating to their separate circles what the intentions of government were, about taking up the bill; with a full account of what the government had said in a whisper the last time they dined with it, and how the government had been observed to wink when it said so; from which premises they were at no loss to draw the conclusion, that if the government had one object more at heart than another, that one object was the welfare and advantage of the United Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="NN.c2.p46"><s sid="99" id="NN.c2.s99">Meanwhile, and pending the arrangement of the proceedings, and a fair division of the speechifying, the public in the large room were eyeing, by turns, the empty platform, and the ladies in the Music Gallery.</s> <s sid="100" id="NN.c2.s100">In these amusements the greater portion of them had been occupied for a couple of hours before, and as the most agreeable diversions pall upon the taste on a too protracted enjoyment of them, the sterner spirits now began to hammer the floor with their boot-heels, and to express their dissatisfaction by various hoots and cries.</s> <s sid="101" id="NN.c2.s101">These vocal exertions, emanating from the people who had been there longest, naturally proceeded from those who were nearest to the platform and furthest from the policemen in attendance, who having no great mind to fight their way through the crowd, but entertaining nevertheless a praiseworthy desire to do something to quell the disturbance, immediately began to drag forth, by the coat tails and collars, all the quiet people near the door; at the same time dealing out various smart and tingling blows with their truncheons, after the manner of that ingenious actor, Mr Punch: whose brilliant example, both in the fashion of his weapons and their use, this branch of the executive occasionally follows.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="NN.c2.p53"><s sid="123" id="NN.c2.s123">The resolution was, of course, carried with loud acclamations, every man holding up both hands in favour of it, as he would in his enthusiasm have held up both legs also, if he could have conveniently accomplished it.</s> <s sid="124" id="NN.c2.s124">This done, the draft of the proposed petition was read at length: and the petition said, as all petitions DO say, that the petitioners were very humble, and the petitioned very honourable, and the object very virtuous; therefore (said the petition) the bill ought to be passed into a law at once, to the everlasting honour and glory of that most honourable and glorious Commons of England in Parliament assembled.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="NN.c2.p54"><s sid="125" id="NN.c2.s125">Then, the gentleman who had been at Crockford's all night, and who looked something the worse about the eyes in consequence, came forward to tell his fellow-countrymen what a speech he meant to make in favour of that petition whenever it should be presented, and how desperately he meant to taunt the parliament if they rejected the bill; and to inform them also, that he regretted his honourable friends had not inserted a clause rendering the purchase of muffins and crumpets compulsory upon all classes of the community, which he --opposing all half-measures, and preferring to go the extreme animal-- pledged himself to propose and divide upon, in committee.</s> <s sid="126" id="NN.c2.s126">After announcing this determination, the honourable gentleman grew jocular; and as patent boots, lemon-coloured kid gloves, and a fur coat collar, assist jokes materially, there was immense laughter and much cheering, and moreover such a brilliant display of ladies' pocket-handkerchiefs, as threw the grievous gentleman quite into the shade.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="NN.c2.p55"><s sid="127" id="NN.c2.s127">And when the petition had been read and was about to be adopted, there came forward the Irish member (who was a young gentleman of ardent temperament,) with such a speech as only an Irish member can make, breathing the true soul and spirit of poetry, and poured forth with such fervour, that it made one warm to look at him; in the course whereof, he told them how he would demand the extension of that great boon to his native country; how he would claim for her equal rights in the muffin laws as in all other laws; and how he yet hoped to see the day when crumpets should be toasted in her lowly cabins, and muffin bells should ring in her rich green valleys.</s> <s sid="128" id="NN.c2.s128">And, after him, came the Scotch member, with various pleasant allusions to the probable amount of profits, which increased the good humour that the poetry had awakened; and all the speeches put together did exactly what they were intended to do, and established in the hearers' minds that there was no speculation so promising, or at the same time so praiseworthy, as the United Metropolitan Improved Hot Muffin and Crumpet Baking and Punctual Delivery Company.</s> </p>

<p pid="56" id="NN.c2.p56"><s sid="129" id="NN.c2.s129">So, the petition in favour of the bill was agreed upon, and the meeting adjourned with acclamations, and Mr Nickleby and the other directors went to the office to lunch, as they did every day at half-past one o'clock; and to remunerate themselves for which trouble, (as the company was yet in its infancy,) they only charged three guineas each man for every such attendance.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c4.p2"><s sid="8" id="NN.c4.s8">The reality is rather different, but by no means to be despised notwithstanding.</s> <s sid="9" id="NN.c4.s9">There, at the very core of London, in the heart of its business and animation, in the midst of a whirl of noise and motion: stemming as it were the giant currents of life that flow ceaselessly on from different quarters, and meet beneath its walls: stands Newgate; and in that crowded street on which it frowns so darkly--within a few feet of the squalid tottering houses--upon the very spot on which the vendors of soup and fish and damaged fruit are now plying their trades--scores of human beings, amidst a roar of sounds to which even the tumult of a great city is as nothing, four, six, or eight strong men at a time, have been hurried violently and swiftly from the world, when the scene has been rendered frightful with excess of human life; when curious eyes have glared from casement and house-top, and wall and pillar; and when, in the mass of white and upturned faces, the dying wretch, in his all-comprehensive look of agony, has met not one--not one--that bore the impress of pity or compassion.</s> </p>

having done which, he consigned the parcel to its old place, put up his spectacles again, and stared at everybody in turn.</s> <s sid="178" id="NN.c5.s178">After this, he took another blow at the horn by way of refreshment; and, having now exhausted his usual topics of conversation, folded his arms as well as he could in so many coats, and falling into a solemn silence, looked carelessly at the familiar objects which met his eye on every side as the coach rolled on;

<p pid="89" id="NN.c5.p89"><s sid="179" id="NN.c5.s179">The weather was intensely and bitterly cold; a great deal of snow fell from time to time; and the wind was intolerably keen.</s> <s sid="180" id="NN.c5.s180">Mr Squeers got down at almost every stage--to stretch his legs as he said--and as he always came back from such excursions with a very red nose, and composed himself to sleep directly, there is reason to suppose that he derived great benefit from the process.</s> <s sid="181" id="NN.c5.s181">The little pupils having been stimulated with the remains of their breakfast, and further invigorated by sundry small cups of a curious cordial carried by Mr Squeers, which tasted very like toast-and-water put into a brandy bottle by mistake, went to sleep, woke, shivered, and cried, as their feelings prompted.</s> <s sid="182" id="NN.c5.s182">Nicholas and the good-tempered man found so many things to talk about, that between conversing together, and cheering up the boys, the time passed with them as rapidly as it could, under such adverse circumstances.</s> </p>

<p pid="91" id="NN.c5.p91"><s sid="187" id="NN.c5.s187">The night and the snow came on together, and dismal enough they were.</s> <s sid="188" id="NN.c5.s188">There was no sound to be heard but the howling of the wind; for the noise of the wheels, and the tread of the horses' feet, were rendered inaudible by the thick coating of snow which covered the ground, and was fast increasing every moment.</s> <s sid="189" id="NN.c5.s189">The streets of Stamford were deserted as they passed through the town; and its old churches rose, frowning and dark, from the whitened ground.</s> <s sid="190" id="NN.c5.s190">Twenty miles further on, two of the front outside passengers, wisely availing themselves of their arrival at one of the best inns in England, turned in, for the night, at the George at Grantham.</s> <s sid="191" id="NN.c5.s191">The remainder wrapped themselves more closely in their coats and cloaks, and leaving the light and warmth of the town behind them, pillowed themselves against the luggage, and prepared, with many half- suppressed moans, again to encounter the piercing blast which swept across the open country.</s> </p>

<p pid="92" id="NN.c5.p92"><s sid="192" id="NN.c5.s192">They were little more than a stage out of Grantham, or about halfway between it and Newark, when Nicholas, who had been asleep for a short time, was suddenly roused by a violent jerk which nearly threw him from his seat.</s> <s sid="193" id="NN.c5.s193">Grasping the rail, he found that the coach had sunk greatly on one side, though it was still dragged forward by the horses; and while--confused by their plunging and the loud screams of the lady inside--he hesitated, for an instant, whether to jump off or not, the vehicle turned easily over, and relieved him from all further uncertainty by flinging him into the road.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="11" id="NN.c6.p11"><s sid="25" id="NN.c6.s25">In fact, a man on horseback galloped down, before the passengers were well collected together; and a careful investigation being instituted, it appeared that the lady inside had broken her lamp, and the gentleman his head; that the two front outsides had escaped with black eyes; the box with a bloody nose; the coachman with a contusion on the temple; Mr Squeers with a portmanteau bruise on his back; and the remaining passengers without any injury at all--thanks to the softness of the snow-drift in which they had been overturned.</s> <s sid="26" id="NN.c6.s26">These facts were no sooner thoroughly ascertained, than the lady gave several indications of fainting, but being forewarned that if she did, she must be carried on some gentleman's shoulders to the nearest public-house, she prudently thought better of it, and walked back with the rest.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="NN.c8.p34"><s sid="57" id="NN.c8.s57">But the pupils--the young noblemen!</s> <s sid="58" id="NN.c8.s58">How the last faint traces of hope, the remotest glimmering of any good to be derived from his efforts in this den, faded from the mind of Nicholas as he looked in dismay around!</s> <s sid="59" id="NN.c8.s59">Pale and haggard faces, lank and bony figures, children with the countenances of old men, deformities with irons upon their limbs, boys of stunted growth, and others whose long meagre legs would hardly bear their stooping bodies, all crowded on the view together; there were the bleared eye, the hare-lip, the crooked foot, and every ugliness or distortion that told of unnatural aversion conceived by parents for their offspring, or of young lives which, from the earliest dawn of infancy, had been one horrible endurance of cruelty and neglect.</s> <s sid="60" id="NN.c8.s60">There were little faces which should have been handsome, darkened with the scowl of sullen, dogged suffering; there was childhood with the light of its eye quenched, its beauty gone, and its helplessness alone remaining; there were vicious-faced boys, brooding, with leaden eyes, like malefactors in a jail; and there were young creatures on whom the sins of their frail parents had descended, weeping even for the mercenary nurses they had known, and lonesome even in their loneliness.</s> <s sid="61" id="NN.c8.s61">With every kindly sympathy and affection blasted in its birth, with every young and healthy feeling flogged and starved down, with every revengeful passion that can fester in swollen hearts, eating its evil way to their core in silence, what an incipient Hell was breeding here!</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="NN.c8.p35"><s sid="62" id="NN.c8.s62">And yet this scene, painful as it was, had its grotesque features, which, in a less interested observer than Nicholas, might have provoked a smile.</s> <s sid="63" id="NN.c8.s63">Mrs Squeers stood at one of the desks, presiding over an immense basin of brimstone and treacle, of which delicious compound she administered a large instalment to each boy in succession: using for the purpose a common wooden spoon, which might have been originally manufactured for some gigantic top, and which widened every young gentleman's mouth considerably: they being all obliged, under heavy corporal penalties, to take in the whole of the bowl at a gasp.</s> <s sid="64" id="NN.c8.s64">In another corner, huddled together for companionship, were the little boys who had arrived on the preceding night, three of them in very large leather breeches, and two in old trousers, a something tighter fit than drawers are usually worn; at no great distance from these was seated the juvenile son and heir of Mr Squeers--a striking likeness of his father--kicking, with great vigour, under the hands of Smike, who was fitting upon him a pair of new boots that bore a most suspicious resemblance to those which the least of the little boys had worn on the journey down--as the little boy himself seemed to think, for he was regarding the appropriation with a look of most rueful amazement.</s> <s sid="65" id="NN.c8.s65">Besides these, there was a long row of boys waiting, with countenances of no pleasant anticipation, to be treacled; and another file, who had just escaped from the infliction, making a variety of wry mouths indicative of anything but satisfaction.</s> <s sid="66" id="NN.c8.s66">The whole were attired in such motley, ill-assorted, extraordinary garments, as would have been irresistibly ridiculous, but for the foul appearance of dirt, disorder, and disease, with which they were associated.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="NN.c8.p36" type="speech"><s sid="67" id="NN.c8.s67"><qs/>'Now,'<qe/><sls/> said Squeers, giving the desk a great rap with his cane, which made half the little boys nearly jump out of their boots, <sle/><qs/>'is that physicking over?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="37" id="NN.c8.p37" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="NN.c8.s68"><qs/>'Just over,'<qe/> said Mrs Squeers, choking the last boy in her hurry, and tapping the crown of his head with the wooden spoon to restore him.</s> <s sid="69" id="NN.c8.s69"><qs/>'Here, you Smike; take away now.</s> <s sid="70" id="NN.c8.s70">Look sharp!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="38" id="NN.c8.p38"><s sid="71" id="NN.c8.s71">Smike shuffled out with the basin, and Mrs Squeers having called up a little boy with a curly head, and wiped her hands upon it, hurried out after him into a species of wash-house, where there was a small fire and a large kettle, together with a number of little wooden bowls which were arranged upon a board.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c9.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c9.s1">When Mr Squeers left the schoolroom for the night, he betook himself, as has been before remarked, to his own fireside, which was situated--not in the room in which Nicholas had supped on the night of his arrival, but in a smaller apartment in the rear of the premises, where his lady wife, his amiable son, and accomplished daughter, were in the full enjoyment of each other's society; Mrs Squeers being engaged in the matronly pursuit of stocking-darning; and the young lady and gentleman being occupied in the adjustment of some youthful differences, by means of a pugilistic contest across the table, which, on the approach of their honoured parent, subsided into a noiseless exchange of kicks beneath it.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c9.p2"><s sid="2" id="NN.c9.s2">And, in this place, it may be as well to apprise the reader, that Miss Fanny Squeers was in her three-and-twentieth year.</s> <s sid="3" id="NN.c9.s3">If there be any one grace or loveliness inseparable from that particular period of life, Miss Squeers may be presumed to have been possessed of it, as there is no reason to suppose that she was a solitary exception to an universal rule.</s> <s sid="4" id="NN.c9.s4">She was not tall like her mother, but short like her father; from the former she inherited a voice of harsh quality; from the latter a remarkable expression of the right eye, something akin to having none at all.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="NN.c9.p3"><s sid="5" id="NN.c9.s5">Miss Squeers had been spending a few days with a neighbouring friend, and had only just returned to the parental roof.</s> <s sid="6" id="NN.c9.s6">To this circumstance may be referred, her having heard nothing of Nicholas, until Mr Squeers himself now made him the subject of conversation.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="NN.c9.p13"><s sid="20" id="NN.c9.s20">Neither were they meant to bear reference to each other, so much as to the object on whom they were bestowed, as will be seen in the present case: a peacock with a turned-up nose being a novelty in ornithology, and a thing not commonly seen.</s> </p>

<p pid="75" id="NN.c9.p75"><s sid="121" id="NN.c9.s121">Whenever such opportunities as these occurred, it was Squeers's custom to drive over to the market town, every evening, on pretence of urgent business, and stop till ten or eleven o'clock at a tavern he much affected.</s> <s sid="122" id="NN.c9.s122">As the party was not in his way, therefore, but rather afforded a means of compromise with Miss Squeers, he readily yielded his full assent thereunto, and willingly communicated to Nicholas that he was expected to take his tea in the parlour that evening, at five o'clock.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c14.p2"><s sid="4" id="NN.c14.s4">The fowls who peck about the kennels, jerking their bodies hither and thither with a gait which none but town fowls are ever seen to adopt, and which any country cock or hen would be puzzled to understand, are perfectly in keeping with the crazy habitations of their owners.</s> <s sid="5" id="NN.c14.s5">Dingy, ill-plumed, drowsy flutterers, sent, like many of the neighbouring children, to get a livelihood in the streets, they hop, from stone to stone, in forlorn search of some hidden eatable in the mud, and can scarcely raise a crow among them.</s> <s sid="6" id="NN.c14.s6">The only one with anything approaching to a voice, is an aged bantam at the baker's; and even he is hoarse, in consequence of bad living in his last place.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="NN.c14.p3"><s sid="7" id="NN.c14.s7">To judge from the size of the houses, they have been, at one time, tenanted by persons of better condition than their present occupants; but they are now let off, by the week, in floors or rooms, and every door has almost as many plates or bell-handles as there are apartments within.</s> <s sid="8" id="NN.c14.s8">The windows are, for the same reason, sufficiently diversified in appearance, being ornamented with every variety of common blind and curtain that can easily be imagined; while every doorway is blocked up, and rendered nearly impassable, by a motley collection of children and porter pots of all sizes, from the baby in arms and the half-pint pot, to the full-grown girl and half-gallon can.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="NN.c14.p4"><s sid="9" id="NN.c14.s9">In the parlour of one of these houses, which was perhaps a thought dirtier than any of its neighbours; which exhibited more bell- handles, children, and porter pots, and caught in all its freshness the first gust of the thick black smoke that poured forth, night and day, from a large brewery hard by; hung a bill, announcing that there was yet one room to let within its walls, though on what story the vacant room could be--regard being had to the outward tokens of many lodgers which the whole front displayed, from the mangle in the kitchen window to the flower-pots on the parapet--it would have been beyond the power of a calculating boy to discover.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="NN.c14.p5"><s sid="10" id="NN.c14.s10">The common stairs of this mansion were bare and carpetless; but a curious visitor who had to climb his way to the top, might have observed that there were not wanting indications of the progressive poverty of the inmates, although their rooms were shut.</s> <s sid="11" id="NN.c14.s11">Thus, the first-floor lodgers, being flush of furniture, kept an old mahogany table--real mahogany--on the landing-place outside, which was only taken in, when occasion required.</s> <s sid="12" id="NN.c14.s12">On the second story, the spare furniture dwindled down to a couple of old deal chairs, of which one, belonging to the back-room, was shorn of a leg, and bottomless.</s> <s sid="13" id="NN.c14.s13">The story above, boasted no greater excess than a worm-eaten wash- tub; and the garret landing-place displayed no costlier articles than two crippled pitchers, and some broken blacking-bottles.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NN.c14.p6"><s sid="14" id="NN.c14.s14">It was on this garret landing-place that a hard-featured square- faced man, elderly and shabby, stopped to unlock the door of the front attic, into which, having surmounted the task of turning the rusty key in its still more rusty wards, he walked with the air of legal owner.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="NN.c14.p7"><s sid="15" id="NN.c14.s15">This person wore a wig of short, coarse, red hair, which he took off with his hat, and hung upon a nail.</s> <s sid="16" id="NN.c14.s16">Having adopted in its place a dirty cotton nightcap, and groped about in the dark till he found a remnant of candle, he knocked at the partition which divided the two garrets, and inquired, in a loud voice, whether Mr Noggs had a light.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="NN.c14.p8"><s sid="17" id="NN.c14.s17">The sounds that came back were stifled by the lath and plaster, and it seemed moreover as though the speaker had uttered them from the interior of a mug or other drinking vessel; but they were in the voice of Newman, and conveyed a reply in the affirmative.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="NN.c14.p9" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="NN.c14.s18"><qs/>'A nasty night, Mr Noggs!'<qe/> said the man in the nightcap, stepping in to light his candle.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="NN.c14.p10" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="NN.c14.s19"><qs/>'Does it rain?'<qe/> asked Newman.</s> </p><p pid="11" id="NN.c14.p11" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="NN.c14.s20"><qs/>'Does it?'<qe/> replied the other pettishly.</s> <s sid="21" id="NN.c14.s21"><qs/>'I am wet through.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="12" id="NN.c14.p12" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="NN.c14.s22"><qs/>'It doesn't take much to wet you and me through, Mr Crowl,'<qe/> said Newman, laying his hand upon the lappel of his threadbare coat.</s> </p><p pid="13" id="NN.c14.p13" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="NN.c14.s23"><qs/>'Well; and that makes it the more vexatious,'<qe/> observed Mr Crowl, in the same pettish tone.</s> </p><p pid="14" id="NN.c14.p14"><s sid="24" id="NN.c14.s24">Uttering a low querulous growl, the speaker, whose harsh countenance was the very epitome of selfishness, raked the scanty fire nearly out of the grate, and, emptying the glass which Noggs had pushed towards him, inquired where he kept his coals.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="NN.c14.p15"><s sid="25" id="NN.c14.s25">Newman Noggs pointed to the bottom of a cupboard, and Mr Crowl, seizing the shovel, threw on half the stock: which Noggs very deliberately took off again, without saying a word.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="NN.c14.p16" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="NN.c14.s26"><qs/>'You have not turned saving, at this time of day, I hope?'<qe/> said Crowl.</s> </p><p pid="17" id="NN.c14.p17"><s sid="27" id="NN.c14.s27">Newman pointed to the empty glass, as though it were a sufficient refutation of the charge, and briefly said that he was going downstairs to supper.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="NN.c14.p18" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="NN.c14.s28"><qs/>'To the Kenwigses?'<qe/> asked Crowl.</s> </p><p pid="19" id="NN.c14.p19"><s sid="29" id="NN.c14.s29">Newman nodded assent.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="NN.c14.p20" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="NN.c14.s30"><qs/>'Think of that now!'<qe/> said Crowl.</s> <s sid="31" id="NN.c14.s31"><qs/>'If I didn't--thinking that you were certain not to go, because you said you wouldn't--tell Kenwigs I couldn't come, and make up my mind to spend the evening with you!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="21" id="NN.c14.p21" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="NN.c14.s32"><qs/>'I was obliged to go,'<qe/> said Newman.</s> <s sid="33" id="NN.c14.s33"><qs/>'They would have me.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="22" id="NN.c14.p22" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="NN.c14.s34"><qs/>'Well; but what's to become of me?'<qe/> urged the selfish man, who never thought of anybody else.</s> <s sid="35" id="NN.c14.s35"><qs/>'It's all your fault.</s> <s sid="36" id="NN.c14.s36">I'll tell you what --I'll sit by your fire till you come back again.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="NN.c14.p23"><s sid="37" id="NN.c14.s37">Newman cast a despairing glance at his small store of fuel, but, not having the courage to say no--a word which in all his life he never had said at the right time, either to himself or anyone else--gave way to the proposed arrangement.</s> <s sid="38" id="NN.c14.s38">Mr Crowl immediately went about making himself as comfortable, with Newman Nogg's means, as circumstances would admit of his being made.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="NN.c14.p24" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="NN.c14.s39">The lodgers to whom Crowl had made allusion under the designation of <qs/>'the Kenwigses,'<qe/> were the wife and olive branches of one Mr Kenwigs, a turner in ivory, who was looked upon as a person of some consideration on the premises, inasmuch as he occupied the whole of the first floor, comprising a suite of two rooms.</s> <s sid="40" id="NN.c14.s40">Mrs Kenwigs, too, was quite a lady in her manners, and of a very genteel family, having an uncle who collected a water-rate; besides which distinction, the two eldest of her little girls went twice a week to a dancing school in the neighbourhood, and had flaxen hair, tied with blue ribbons, hanging in luxuriant pigtails down their backs; and wore little white trousers with frills round the ankles--for all of which reasons, and many more equally valid but too numerous to mention, Mrs Kenwigs was considered a very desirable person to know, and was the constant theme of all the gossips in the street, and even three or four doors round the corner at both ends.</s> </p><p pid="25" id="NN.c14.p25"><s sid="41" id="NN.c14.s41">It was the anniversary of that happy day on which the Church of England as by law established, had bestowed Mrs Kenwigs upon Mr Kenwigs; and in grateful commemoration of the same, Mrs Kenwigs had invited a few select friends to cards and a supper in the first floor, and had put on a new gown to receive them in: which gown, being of a flaming colour and made upon a juvenile principle, was so successful that Mr Kenwigs said the eight years of matrimony and the five children seemed all a dream, and Mrs Kenwigs younger and more blooming than on the very first Sunday he had kept company with her.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="NN.c14.p26"><s sid="42" id="NN.c14.s42">Beautiful as Mrs Kenwigs looked when she was dressed though, and so stately that you would have supposed she had a cook and housemaid at least, and nothing to do but order them about, she had a world of trouble with the preparations; more, indeed, than she, being of a delicate and genteel constitution, could have sustained, had not the pride of housewifery upheld her.</s> <s sid="43" id="NN.c14.s43">At last, however, all the things that had to be got together were got together, and all the things that had to be got out of the way were got out of the way, and everything was ready, and the collector himself having promised to come, fortune smiled upon the occasion.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="NN.c14.p27"><s sid="44" id="NN.c14.s44">The party was admirably selected.</s> <s sid="45" id="NN.c14.s45">There were, first of all, Mr Kenwigs and Mrs Kenwigs, and four olive Kenwigses who sat up to supper; firstly, because it was but right that they should have a treat on such a day; and secondly, because their going to bed, in presence of the company, would have been inconvenient, not to say improper.</s> <s sid="46" id="NN.c14.s46">Then, there was a young lady who had made Mrs Kenwigs's dress, and who--it was the most convenient thing in the world-- living in the two-pair back, gave up her bed to the baby, and got a little girl to watch it.</s> <s sid="47" id="NN.c14.s47">Then, to match this young lady, was a young man, who had known Mr Kenwigs when he was a bachelor, and was much esteemed by the ladies, as bearing the reputation of a rake.</s> <s sid="48" id="NN.c14.s48">To these were added a newly-married couple, who had visited Mr and Mrs Kenwigs in their courtship; and a sister of Mrs Kenwigs's, who was quite a beauty; besides whom, there was another young man, supposed to entertain honourable designs upon the lady last mentioned; and Mr Noggs, who was a genteel person to ask, because he had been a gentleman once.</s> <s sid="49" id="NN.c14.s49">There were also an elderly lady from the back-parlour, and one more young lady, who, next to the collector, perhaps was the great lion of the party, being the daughter of a theatrical fireman, who 'went on' in the pantomime, and had the greatest turn for the stage that was ever known, being able to sing and recite in a manner that brought the tears into Mrs Kenwigs's eyes.</s> <s sid="50" id="NN.c14.s50">There was only one drawback upon the pleasure of seeing such friends, and that was, that the lady in the back-parlour, who was very fat, and turned of sixty, came in a low book-muslin dress and short kid gloves, which so exasperated Mrs Kenwigs, that that lady assured her visitors, in private, that if it hadn't happened that the supper was cooking at the back-parlour grate at that moment, she certainly would have requested its representative to withdraw.</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="NN.c14.p28" type="speech"><s sid="51" id="NN.c14.s51"><qs/>'My dear,'<qe/><sss/> said Mr Kenwigs, <sse/><qs/>'wouldn't it be better to begin a round game?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="29" id="NN.c14.p29" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="NN.c14.s52"><qs/>'Kenwigs, my dear,'<qe/><sss/> returned his wife, <sse/><qs/>'I am surprised at you.</s> <s sid="53" id="NN.c14.s53">Would you begin without my uncle?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="30" id="NN.c14.p30" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="NN.c14.s54"><qs/>'I forgot the collector,'<qe/><sss/> said Kenwigs; <sse/><qs/>'oh no, that would never do.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="31" id="NN.c14.p31" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="NN.c14.s55"><qs/>'He's so particular,'<qe/><sls/> said Mrs Kenwigs, turning to the other married lady, <sle/><qs/>'that if we began without him, I should be out of his will for ever.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="32" id="NN.c14.p32" type="speech"><s sid="56" id="NN.c14.s56"><qs/>'Dear!'<qe/> cried the married lady.</s> </p><p pid="33" id="NN.c14.p33" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="NN.c14.s57"><qs/>'You've no idea what he is,'<qe/><sss/> replied Mrs Kenwigs; <sse/><qs/>'and yet as good a creature as ever breathed.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="34" id="NN.c14.p34" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="NN.c14.s58"><qs/>'The kindest-hearted man as ever was,'<qe/> said Kenwigs.</s> </p><p pid="35" id="NN.c14.p35" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="NN.c14.s59"><qs/>'It goes to his heart, I believe, to be forced to cut the water off, when the people don't pay,'<qe/> observed the bachelor friend, intending a joke.</s> </p><p pid="36" id="NN.c14.p36" type="speech"><s sid="60" id="NN.c14.s60"><qs/>'George,'<qe/><sss/> said Mr Kenwigs, solemnly, <sse/><qs/>'none of that, if you please.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="37" id="NN.c14.p37" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="NN.c14.s61"><qs/>'It was only my joke,'<qe/> said the friend, abashed.</s> </p><p pid="38" id="NN.c14.p38" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="NN.c14.s62"><qs/>'George,'<qe/><sss/> rejoined Mr Kenwigs, <sse/><qs/>'a joke is a wery good thing--a wery good thing--but when that joke is made at the expense of Mrs Kenwigs's feelings, I set my face against it.</s> <s sid="63" id="NN.c14.s63">A man in public life expects to be sneered at--it is the fault of his elewated sitiwation, and not of himself.</s> <s sid="64" id="NN.c14.s64">Mrs Kenwigs's relation is a public man, and that he knows, George, and that he can bear; but putting Mrs Kenwigs out of the question (if I COULD put Mrs Kenwigs out of the question on such an occasion as this), I have the honour to be connected with the collector by marriage; and I cannot allow these remarks in my--'<qe/><sls/>  Mr Kenwigs was going to say <sle/><qs/>'house,'<qe/> but he rounded the sentence with 'apartments'.</s> </p><p pid="39" id="NN.c14.p39"><s sid="65" id="NN.c14.s65">At the conclusion of these observations, which drew forth evidences of acute feeling from Mrs Kenwigs, and had the intended effect of impressing the company with a deep sense of the collector's dignity, a ring was heard at the bell.</s> </p>

<p pid="40" id="NN.c14.p40" type="speech"><s sid="66" id="NN.c14.s66"><qs/>'That's him,'<qe/> whispered Mr Kenwigs, greatly excited.</s> <s sid="67" id="NN.c14.s67"><qs/>'Morleena, my dear, run down and let your uncle in, and kiss him directly you get the door open.</s> <s sid="68" id="NN.c14.s68">Hem!</s> <s sid="69" id="NN.c14.s69">Let's be talking.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="41" id="NN.c14.p41"><s sid="70" id="NN.c14.s70">Adopting Mr Kenwigs's suggestion, the company spoke very loudly, to look easy and unembarrassed; and almost as soon as they had begun to do so, a short old gentleman in drabs and gaiters, with a face that might have been carved out of LIGNUM VITAE, for anything that appeared to the contrary, was led playfully in by Miss Morleena Kenwigs, regarding whose uncommon Christian name it may be here remarked that it had been invented and composed by Mrs Kenwigs previous to her first lying-in, for the special distinction of her eldest child, in case it should prove a daughter.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="NN.c14.p42" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="NN.c14.s71"><qs/>'Oh, uncle, I am SO glad to see you,'<qe/> said Mrs Kenwigs, kissing the collector affectionately on both cheeks.</s> <s sid="72" id="NN.c14.s72"><qs/>'So glad!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="43" id="NN.c14.p43" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="NN.c14.s73"><qs/>'Many happy returns of the day, my dear,'<qe/> replied the collector, returning the compliment.</s> </p><p pid="44" id="NN.c14.p44"><s sid="74" id="NN.c14.s74">Now, this was an interesting thing.</s> <s sid="75" id="NN.c14.s75">Here was a collector of water- rates, without his book, without his pen and ink, without his double knock, without his intimidation, kissing--actually kissing--an agreeable female, and leaving taxes, summonses, notices that he had called, or announcements that he would never call again, for two quarters' due, wholly out of the question.</s> <s sid="76" id="NN.c14.s76">It was pleasant to see how the company looked on, quite absorbed in the sight, and to behold the nods and winks with which they expressed their gratification at finding so much humanity in a tax-gatherer.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="NN.c14.p45" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="NN.c14.s77"><qs/>'Where will you sit, uncle?'<qe/> said Mrs Kenwigs, in the full glow of family pride, which the appearance of her distinguished relation occasioned.</s> </p><p pid="46" id="NN.c14.p46" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="NN.c14.s78"><qs/>'Anywheres, my dear,'<qe/><sss/> said the collector, <sse/><qs/>'I am not particular.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="47" id="NN.c14.p47"><s sid="79" id="NN.c14.s79">Not particular!</s> <s sid="80" id="NN.c14.s80">What a meek collector!</s> <s sid="81" id="NN.c14.s81">If he had been an author, who knew his place, he couldn't have been more humble.</s> </p>

<p pid="52" id="NN.c14.p52"><s sid="93" id="NN.c14.s93">While the ladies were thus busying themselves, Mr Lillyvick was intent upon the game in progress, and as all should be fish that comes to a water-collector's net, the dear old gentleman was by no means scrupulous in appropriating to himself the property of his neighbours, which, on the contrary, he abstracted whenever an opportunity presented itself, smiling good-humouredly all the while, and making so many condescending speeches to the owners, that they were delighted with his amiability, and thought in their hearts that he deserved to be Chancellor of the Exchequer at least.</s> </p>

<p pid="53" id="NN.c14.p53"><s sid="94" id="NN.c14.s94">After a great deal of trouble, and the administration of many slaps on the head to the infant Kenwigses, whereof two of the most rebellious were summarily banished, the cloth was laid with much elegance, and a pair of boiled fowls, a large piece of pork, apple- pie, potatoes and greens, were served; at sight of which, the worthy Mr Lillyvick vented a great many witticisms, and plucked up amazingly: to the immense delight and satisfaction of the whole body of admirers.</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="NN.c14.p54"><s sid="95" id="NN.c14.s95">Very well and very fast the supper went off; no more serious difficulties occurring, than those which arose from the incessant demand for clean knives and forks; which made poor Mrs Kenwigs wish, more than once, that private society adopted the principle of schools, and required that every guest should bring his own knife, fork, and spoon; which doubtless would be a great accommodation in many cases, and to no one more so than to the lady and gentleman of the house, especially if the school principle were carried out to the full extent, and the articles were expected, as a matter of delicacy, not to be taken away again.</s> </p>

<p pid="55" id="NN.c14.p55"><s sid="96" id="NN.c14.s96">Everybody having eaten everything, the table was cleared in a most alarming hurry, and with great noise; and the spirits, whereat the eyes of Newman Noggs glistened, being arranged in order, with water both hot and cold, the party composed themselves for conviviality; Mr Lillyvick being stationed in a large armchair by the fireside, and the four little Kenwigses disposed on a small form in front of the company with their flaxen tails towards them, and their faces to the fire; an arrangement which was no sooner perfected, than Mrs Kenwigs was overpowered by the feelings of a mother, and fell upon the left shoulder of Mr Kenwigs dissolved in tears.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 15 Acquaints the Reader with the Cause and Origin of the Interruption described in the last Chapter, and with some other Matters necessary to be known</title>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c15.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c15.s1">Newman Noggs scrambled in violent haste upstairs with the steaming beverage, which he had so unceremoniously snatched from the table of Mr Kenwigs, and indeed from the very grasp of the water-rate collector, who was eyeing the contents of the tumbler, at the moment of its unexpected abstraction, with lively marks of pleasure visible in his countenance.</s> <s sid="2" id="NN.c15.s2">He bore his prize straight to his own back- garret, where, footsore and nearly shoeless, wet, dirty, jaded, and disfigured with every mark of fatiguing travel, sat Nicholas and Smike, at once the cause and partner of his toil; both perfectly worn out by their unwonted and protracted exertion.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c15.p2"><s sid="3" id="NN.c15.s3">Newman's first act was to compel Nicholas, with gentle force, to swallow half of the punch at a breath, nearly boiling as it was; and his next, to pour the remainder down the throat of Smike, who, never having tasted anything stronger than aperient medicine in his whole life, exhibited various odd manifestations of surprise and delight, during the passage of the liquor down his throat, and turned up his eyes most emphatically when it was all gone.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="NN.c15.p3" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="NN.c15.s4"><qs/>'You are wet through,'<qe/><sls/> said Newman, passing his hand hastily over the coat which Nicholas had thrown off; <sle/><qs/>'and I--I--haven't even a change,'<qe/> he added, with a wistful glance at the shabby clothes he wore himself.</s> </p><p pid="4" id="NN.c15.p4" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="NN.c15.s5"><qs/>'I have dry clothes, or at least such as will serve my turn well, in my bundle,'<qe/> replied Nicholas.</s> <s sid="6" id="NN.c15.s6"><qs/>'If you look so distressed to see me, you will add to the pain I feel already, at being compelled, for one night, to cast myself upon your slender means for aid and shelter.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="NN.c15.p5"><s sid="7" id="NN.c15.s7">Newman did not look the less distressed to hear Nicholas talking in this strain; but, upon his young friend grasping him heartily by the hand, and assuring him that nothing but implicit confidence in the sincerity of his professions, and kindness of feeling towards himself, would have induced him, on any consideration, even to have made him acquainted with his arrival in London, Mr Noggs brightened up again, and went about making such arrangements as were in his power for the comfort of his visitors, with extreme alacrity.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NN.c15.p6"><s sid="8" id="NN.c15.s8">These were simple enough; poor Newman's means halting at a very considerable distance short of his inclinations; but, slight as they were, they were not made without much bustling and running about.</s> <s sid="9" id="NN.c15.s9">As Nicholas had husbanded his scanty stock of money, so well that it was not yet quite expended, a supper of bread and cheese, with some cold beef from the cook's shop, was soon placed upon the table; and these viands being flanked by a bottle of spirits and a pot of porter, there was no ground for apprehension on the score of hunger or thirst, at all events.</s> <s sid="10" id="NN.c15.s10">Such preparations as Newman had it in his power to make, for the accommodation of his guests during the night, occupied no very great time in completing; and as he had insisted, as an express preliminary, that Nicholas should change his clothes, and that Smike should invest himself in his solitary coat (which no entreaties would dissuade him from stripping off for the purpose), the travellers partook of their frugal fare, with more satisfaction than one of them at least had derived from many a better meal.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="NN.c15.p7"><s sid="11" id="NN.c15.s11">They then drew near the fire, which Newman Noggs had made up as well as he could, after the inroads of Crowl upon the fuel; and Nicholas, who had hitherto been restrained by the extreme anxiety of his friend that he should refresh himself after his journey, now pressed him with earnest questions concerning his mother and sister.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c22.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c22.s1">The whole capital which Nicholas found himself entitled to, either in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, after paying his rent and settling with the broker from whom he had hired his poor furniture, did not exceed, by more than a few halfpence, the sum of twenty shillings.</s> <s sid="2" id="NN.c22.s2">And yet he hailed the morning on which he had resolved to quit London, with a light heart, and sprang from his bed with an elasticity of spirit which is happily the lot of young persons, or the world would never be stocked with old ones.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c22.p2"><s sid="3" id="NN.c22.s3">It was a cold, dry, foggy morning in early spring.</s> <s sid="4" id="NN.c22.s4">A few meagre shadows flitted to and fro in the misty streets, and occasionally there loomed through the dull vapour, the heavy outline of some hackney coach wending homewards, which, drawing slowly nearer, rolled jangling by, scattering the thin crust of frost from its whitened roof, and soon was lost again in the cloud.</s> <s sid="5" id="NN.c22.s5">At intervals were heard the tread of slipshod feet, and the chilly cry of the poor sweep as he crept, shivering, to his early toil; the heavy footfall of the official watcher of the night, pacing slowly up and down and cursing the tardy hours that still intervened between him and sleep; the rambling of ponderous carts and waggons; the roll of the lighter vehicles which carried buyers and sellers to the different markets; the sound of ineffectual knocking at the doors of heavy sleepers--all these noises fell upon the ear from time to time, but all seemed muffled by the fog, and to be rendered almost as indistinct to the ear as was every object to the sight.</s> <s sid="6" id="NN.c22.s6">The sluggish darkness thickened as the day came on; and those who had the courage to rise and peep at the gloomy street from their curtained windows, crept back to bed again, and coiled themselves up to sleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c23.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c23.s1">As Mr Crummles had a strange four-legged animal in the inn stables, which he called a pony, and a vehicle of unknown design, on which he bestowed the appellation of a four-wheeled phaeton, Nicholas proceeded on his journey next morning with greater ease than he had expected: the manager and himself occupying the front seat: and the Master Crummleses and Smike being packed together behind, in company with a wicker basket defended from wet by a stout oilskin, in which were the broad-swords, pistols, pigtails, nautical costumes, and other professional necessaries of the aforesaid young gentlemen.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c23.p2"><s sid="2" id="NN.c23.s2">The pony took his time upon the road, and--possibly in consequence of his theatrical education--evinced, every now and then, a strong inclination to lie down.</s> <s sid="3" id="NN.c23.s3">However, Mr Vincent Crummles kept him up pretty well, by jerking the rein, and plying the whip; and when these means failed, and the animal came to a stand, the elder Master Crummles got out and kicked him.</s> <s sid="4" id="NN.c23.s4">By dint of these encouragements, he was persuaded to move from time to time, and they jogged on (as Mr Crummles truly observed) very comfortably for all parties.</s> </p>

he rather inclined to the latter opinion, and, being uneasy, relieved his mind with a banquet, during which solemnity somebody in a cloak said <qs/>'Beware!'<qe/> which somebody was known by nobody (except the audience) to be the outlaw himself, who had come there, for reasons unexplained, but possibly with an eye to the spoons.</s> <s sid="87" id="NN.c24.s87">There was an agreeable little surprise in the way of certain love passages between the desponding captive and Miss Snevellicci, and the comic fighting-man and Miss Bravassa;

after which, the patriarch came forward, and observing, with a knowing look, that he knew all about his children now, and would tell them when they got inside, said that there could not be a more appropriate occasion for marrying the young people than that; and therefore he joined their hands, with the full consent of the indefatigable page, who (being the only other person surviving) pointed with his cap into the clouds, and his right hand to the ground;

<title>CHAPTER 28 Miss Nickleby, rendered desperate by the Persecution of Sir Mulberry Hawk, and the Complicated Difficulties and Distresses which surround her, appeals, as a last resource, to her Uncle for Protection</title>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c28.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c28.s1">The ensuing morning brought reflection with it, as morning usually does; but widely different was the train of thought it awakened in the different persons who had been so unexpectedly brought together on the preceding evening, by the active agency of Messrs Pyke and Pluck.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c28.p2"><s sid="2" id="NN.c28.s2">The reflections of Sir Mulberry Hawk--if such a term can be applied to the thoughts of the systematic and calculating man of dissipation, whose joys, regrets, pains, and pleasures, are all of self, and who would seem to retain nothing of the intellectual faculty but the power to debase himself, and to degrade the very nature whose outward semblance he wears--the reflections of Sir Mulberry Hawk turned upon Kate Nickleby, and were, in brief, that she was undoubtedly handsome; that her coyness MUST be easily conquerable by a man of his address and experience, and that the pursuit was one which could not fail to redound to his credit, and greatly to enhance his reputation with the world.</s> <s sid="3" id="NN.c28.s3">And lest this last consideration--no mean or secondary one with Sir Mulberry-- should sound strangely in the ears of some, let it be remembered that most men live in a world of their own, and that in that limited circle alone are they ambitious for distinction and applause.</s> <s sid="4" id="NN.c28.s4">Sir Mulberry's world was peopled with profligates, and he acted accordingly.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="NN.c28.p3"><s sid="5" id="NN.c28.s5">Thus, cases of injustice, and oppression, and tyranny, and the most extravagant bigotry, are in constant occurrence among us every day.</s> <s sid="6" id="NN.c28.s6">It is the custom to trumpet forth much wonder and astonishment at the chief actors therein setting at defiance so completely the opinion of the world; but there is no greater fallacy; it is precisely because they do consult the opinion of their own little world that such things take place at all, and strike the great world dumb with amazement.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="NN.c28.p4" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="NN.c28.s7">The reflections of Mrs Nickleby were of the proudest and most complacent kind; and under the influence of her very agreeable delusion she straightway sat down and indited a long letter to Kate, in which she expressed her entire approval of the admirable choice she had made, and extolled Sir Mulberry to the skies; asserting, for the more complete satisfaction of her daughter's feelings, that he was precisely the individual whom she (Mrs Nickleby) would have chosen for her son-in-law, if she had had the picking and choosing from all mankind.</s> <s sid="8" id="NN.c28.s8">The good lady then, with the preliminary observation that she might be fairly supposed not to have lived in the world so long without knowing its ways, communicated a great many subtle precepts applicable to the state of courtship, and confirmed in their wisdom by her own personal experience.</s> <s sid="9" id="NN.c28.s9">Above all things she commended a strict maidenly reserve, as being not only a very laudable thing in itself, but as tending materially to strengthen and increase a lover's ardour.</s> <s sid="10" id="NN.c28.s10"><qs/>'And I never,'<qe/><sss/> added Mrs Nickleby, <sse/><qs/>'was more delighted in my life than to observe last night, my dear, that your good sense had already told you this.'<qe/></s> <s sid="11" id="NN.c28.s11">With which sentiment, and various hints of the pleasure she derived from the knowledge that her daughter inherited so large an instalment of her own excellent sense and discretion (to nearly the full measure of which she might hope, with care, to succeed in time), Mrs Nickleby concluded a very long and rather illegible letter.</s> </p><p pid="5" id="NN.c28.p5"><s sid="12" id="NN.c28.s12">Poor Kate was well-nigh distracted on the receipt of four closely- written and closely-crossed sides of congratulation on the very subject which had prevented her closing her eyes all night, and kept her weeping and watching in her chamber; still worse and more trying was the necessity of rendering herself agreeable to Mrs Wititterly, who, being in low spirits after the fatigue of the preceding night, of course expected her companion (else wherefore had she board and salary?) to be in the best spirits possible.</s> <s sid="13" id="NN.c28.s13">As to Mr Wititterly, he went about all day in a tremor of delight at having shaken hands with a lord, and having actually asked him to come and see him in his own house.</s> <s sid="14" id="NN.c28.s14">The lord himself, not being troubled to any inconvenient extent with the power of thinking, regaled himself with the conversation of Messrs Pyke and Pluck, who sharpened their wit by a plentiful indulgence in various costly stimulants at his expense.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c29.p2"><s sid="3" id="NN.c29.s3">Possessed of this unexpected wealth, his first act was to enclose to honest John Browdie the amount of his friendly loan, which he accompanied with many expressions of gratitude and esteem, and many cordial wishes for his matrimonial happiness.</s> <s sid="4" id="NN.c29.s4">To Newman Noggs he forwarded one half of the sum he had realised, entreating him to take an opportunity of handing it to Kate in secret, and conveying to her the warmest assurances of his love and affection.</s> <s sid="5" id="NN.c29.s5">He made no mention of the way in which he had employed himself; merely informing Newman that a letter addressed to him under his assumed name at the Post Office, Portsmouth, would readily find him, and entreating that worthy friend to write full particulars of the situation of his mother and sister, and an account of all the grand things that Ralph Nickleby had done for them since his departure from London.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="NN.c29.p27"><s sid="48" id="NN.c29.s48">It was directed to blank Johnson, Esq., by favour of Augustus Folair, Esq.; and the astonishment of Nicholas was in no degree lessened, when he found it to be couched in the following laconic terms:--</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 31 Of Ralph Nickleby and Newman Noggs, and some wise Precautions, the success or failure of which will appear in the Sequel</title>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c31.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c31.s1">In blissful unconsciousness that his nephew was hastening at the utmost speed of four good horses towards his sphere of action, and that every passing minute diminished the distance between them, Ralph Nickleby sat that morning occupied in his customary avocations, and yet unable to prevent his thoughts wandering from time to time back to the interview which had taken place between himself and his niece on the previous day.</s> <s sid="2" id="NN.c31.s2">At such intervals, after a few moments of abstraction, Ralph would mutter some peevish interjection, and apply himself with renewed steadiness of purpose to the ledger before him, but again and again the same train of thought came back despite all his efforts to prevent it, confusing him in his calculations, and utterly distracting his attention from the figures over which he bent.</s> <s sid="3" id="NN.c31.s3">At length Ralph laid down his pen, and threw himself back in his chair as though he had made up his mind to allow the obtrusive current of reflection to take its own course, and, by giving it full scope, to rid himself of it effectually.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c31.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="NN.c31.s4"><qs/>'I am not a man to be moved by a pretty face,'<qe/> muttered Ralph sternly.</s> <s sid="5" id="NN.c31.s5"><qs/>'There is a grinning skull beneath it, and men like me who look and work below the surface see that, and not its delicate covering.</s> <s sid="6" id="NN.c31.s6">And yet I almost like the girl, or should if she had been less proudly and squeamishly brought up.</s> <s sid="7" id="NN.c31.s7">If the boy were drowned or hanged, and the mother dead, this house should be her home.</s> <s sid="8" id="NN.c31.s8">I wish they were, with all my soul.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="3" id="NN.c31.p3"><s sid="9" id="NN.c31.s9">Notwithstanding the deadly hatred which Ralph felt towards Nicholas, and the bitter contempt with which he sneered at poor Mrs Nickleby-- notwithstanding the baseness with which he had behaved, and was then behaving, and would behave again if his interest prompted him, towards Kate herself--still there was, strange though it may seem, something humanising and even gentle in his thoughts at that moment.</s> <s sid="10" id="NN.c31.s10">He thought of what his home might be if Kate were there; he placed her in the empty chair, looked upon her, heard her speak; he felt again upon his arm the gentle pressure of the trembling hand; he strewed his costly rooms with the hundred silent tokens of feminine presence and occupation; he came back again to the cold fireside and the silent dreary splendour; and in that one glimpse of a better nature, born as it was in selfish thoughts, the rich man felt himself friendless, childless, and alone.</s> <s sid="11" id="NN.c31.s11">Gold, for the instant, lost its lustre in his eyes, for there were countless treasures of the heart which it could never purchase.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="NN.c31.p4"><s sid="12" id="NN.c31.s12">A very slight circumstance was sufficient to banish such reflections from the mind of such a man.</s> <s sid="13" id="NN.c31.s13">As Ralph looked vacantly out across the yard towards the window of the other office, he became suddenly aware of the earnest observation of Newman Noggs, who, with his red nose almost touching the glass, feigned to be mending a pen with a rusty fragment of a knife, but was in reality staring at his employer with a countenance of the closest and most eager scrutiny.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="NN.c31.p5"><s sid="14" id="NN.c31.s14">Ralph exchanged his dreamy posture for his accustomed business attitude: the face of Newman disappeared, and the train of thought took to flight, all simultaneously, and in an instant.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NN.c31.p6"><s sid="15" id="NN.c31.s15">After a few minutes, Ralph rang his bell.</s> <s sid="16" id="NN.c31.s16">Newman answered the summons, and Ralph raised his eyes stealthily to his face, as if he almost feared to read there, a knowledge of his recent thoughts.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="NN.c31.p7"><s sid="17" id="NN.c31.s17">There was not the smallest speculation, however, in the countenance of Newman Noggs.</s> <s sid="18" id="NN.c31.s18">If it be possible to imagine a man, with two eyes in his head, and both wide open, looking in no direction whatever, and seeing nothing, Newman appeared to be that man while Ralph Nickleby regarded him.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="NN.c31.p8" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="NN.c31.s19"><qs/>'How now?'<qe/> growled Ralph.</s> </p><p pid="9" id="NN.c31.p9" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="NN.c31.s20"><qs/>'Oh!'<qe/><sls/> said Newman, throwing some intelligence into his eyes all at once, and dropping them on his master, <sle/><qs/>'I thought you rang.'<qe/></s> <s sid="21" id="NN.c31.s21">With which laconic remark Newman turned round and hobbled away.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="NN.c31.p10" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="NN.c31.s22"><qs/>'Stop!'<qe/> said Ralph.</s> </p><p pid="11" id="NN.c31.p11"><s sid="23" id="NN.c31.s23">Newman stopped; not at all disconcerted.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="NN.c31.p22"><s sid="40" id="NN.c31.s40">He executed his commission with great promptitude and dispatch, only calling at one public-house for half a minute, and even that might be said to be in his way, for he went in at one door and came out at the other; but as he returned and had got so far homewards as the Strand, Newman began to loiter with the uncertain air of a man who has not quite made up his mind whether to halt or go straight forwards.</s> <s sid="41" id="NN.c31.s41">After a very short consideration, the former inclination prevailed, and making towards the point he had had in his mind, Newman knocked a modest double knock, or rather a nervous single one, at Miss La Creevy's door.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="NN.c31.p23" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="NN.c31.s42">It was opened by a strange servant, on whom the odd figure of the visitor did not appear to make the most favourable impression possible, inasmuch as she no sooner saw him than she very nearly closed it, and placing herself in the narrow gap, inquired what he wanted.</s> <s sid="43" id="NN.c31.s43">But Newman merely uttering the monosyllable <qs/>'Noggs,'<qe/> as if it were some cabalistic word, at sound of which bolts would fly back and doors open, pushed briskly past and gained the door of Miss La Creevy's sitting-room, before the astonished servant could offer any opposition.</s> </p><p pid="24" id="NN.c31.p24" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="NN.c31.s44"><qs/>'Walk in if you please,'<qe/> said Miss La Creevy in reply to the sound of Newman's knuckles;

<p pid="6" id="NN.c32.p6"><s sid="8" id="NN.c32.s8">As they dashed by the quickly-changing and ever-varying objects, it was curious to observe in what a strange procession they passed before the eye.</s> <s sid="9" id="NN.c32.s9">Emporiums of splendid dresses, the materials brought from every quarter of the world; tempting stores of everything to stimulate and pamper the sated appetite and give new relish to the oft-repeated feast; vessels of burnished gold and silver, wrought into every exquisite form of vase, and dish, and goblet; guns, swords, pistols, and patent engines of destruction; screws and irons for the crooked, clothes for the newly-born, drugs for the sick, coffins for the dead, and churchyards for the buried-- all these jumbled each with the other and flocking side by side, seemed to flit by in motley dance like the fantastic groups of the old Dutch painter, and with the same stern moral for the unheeding restless crowd.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="NN.c32.p7"><s sid="10" id="NN.c32.s10">Nor were there wanting objects in the crowd itself to give new point and purpose to the shifting scene.</s> <s sid="11" id="NN.c32.s11">The rags of the squalid ballad- singer fluttered in the rich light that showed the goldsmith's treasures, pale and pinched-up faces hovered about the windows where was tempting food, hungry eyes wandered over the profusion guarded by one thin sheet of brittle glass--an iron wall to them; half-naked shivering figures stopped to gaze at Chinese shawls and golden stuffs of India.</s> <s sid="12" id="NN.c32.s12">There was a christening party at the largest coffin-maker's and a funeral hatchment had stopped some great improvements in the bravest mansion.</s> <s sid="13" id="NN.c32.s13">Life and death went hand in hand; wealth and poverty stood side by side; repletion and starvation laid them down together.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="NN.c32.p8"><s sid="14" id="NN.c32.s14">But it was London; and the old country lady inside, who had put her head out of the coach-window a mile or two this side Kingston, and cried out to the driver that she was sure he must have passed it and forgotten to set her down, was satisfied at last.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="NN.c32.p9"><s sid="15" id="NN.c32.s15">Nicholas engaged beds for himself and Smike at the inn where the coach stopped, and repaired, without the delay of another moment, to the lodgings of Newman Noggs; for his anxiety and impatience had increased with every succeeding minute, and were almost beyond control.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="NN.c32.p10"><s sid="16" id="NN.c32.s16">There was a fire in Newman's garret; and a candle had been left burning; the floor was cleanly swept, the room was as comfortably arranged as such a room could be, and meat and drink were placed in order upon the table.</s> <s sid="17" id="NN.c32.s17">Everything bespoke the affectionate care and attention of Newman Noggs, but Newman himself was not there.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="NN.c32.p16"><s sid="29" id="NN.c32.s29">Disappointed and uneasy, Nicholas could touch no food, so, after he had seen Smike comfortably established at the table, he walked out (despite a great many dissuasions uttered by Mr Crowl with his mouth full), and left Smike to detain Newman in case he returned first.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="NN.c32.p17"><s sid="30" id="NN.c32.s30">As Miss La Creevy had anticipated, Nicholas betook himself straight to her house.</s> <s sid="31" id="NN.c32.s31">Finding her from home, he debated within himself for some time whether he should go to his mother's residence, and so compromise her with Ralph Nickleby.</s> <s sid="32" id="NN.c32.s32">Fully persuaded, however, that Newman would not have solicited him to return unless there was some strong reason which required his presence at home, he resolved to go there, and hastened eastwards with all speed.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="NN.c32.p25"><s sid="57" id="NN.c32.s57">It was very handsomely furnished.</s> <s sid="58" id="NN.c32.s58">The walls were ornamented with the choicest specimens of French paper, enriched with a gilded cornice of elegant design.</s> <s sid="59" id="NN.c32.s59">The floor was covered with a rich carpet; and two superb mirrors, one above the chimneypiece and one at the opposite end of the room reaching from floor to ceiling, multiplied the other beauties and added new ones of their own to enhance the general effect.</s> <s sid="60" id="NN.c32.s60">There was a rather noisy party of four gentlemen in a box by the fire-place, and only two other persons present--both elderly gentlemen, and both alone.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="NN.c32.p26"><s sid="61" id="NN.c32.s61">Observing all this in the first comprehensive glance with which a stranger surveys a place that is new to him, Nicholas sat himself down in the box next to the noisy party, with his back towards them, and postponing his order for a pint of claret until such time as the waiter and one of the elderly gentlemen should have settled a disputed question relative to the price of an item in the bill of fare, took up a newspaper and began to read.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="NN.c34.p7"><s sid="10" id="NN.c34.s10">As Newman stated it, the cause himself swaggered into the room, and grasping Ralph's horny hand with uncommon affection, vowed that he had never seen him looking so well in all his life.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="NN.c35.p4" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="NN.c35.s6"><qs/>'However,'<qe/><sls/> thought Nicholas as he departed on his benevolent errand; <sle/><qs/>'she cannot fail to become attached to him, when she knows what a devoted creature he is, and as she must quickly make the discovery, his probation will be a short one.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="NN.c35.p5" type="speech"><s sid="7" id="NN.c35.s7"><qs/>'I was afraid,'<qe/><sls/> said Smike, overjoyed to see his friend again, <sle/><qs/>'that you had fallen into some fresh trouble; the time seemed so long, at last, that I almost feared you were lost.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="NN.c35.p6" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="NN.c35.s8"><qs/>'Lost!'<qe/> replied Nicholas gaily.</s> <s sid="9" id="NN.c35.s9"><qs/>'You will not be rid of me so easily, I promise you.</s> <s sid="10" id="NN.c35.s10">I shall rise to the surface many thousand times yet, and the harder the thrust that pushes me down, the more quickly I shall rebound, Smike.</s> <s sid="11" id="NN.c35.s11">But come; my errand here is to take you home.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="7" id="NN.c35.p7" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="NN.c35.s12"><qs/>'Home!'<qe/> faltered Smike, drawing timidly back.</s> </p><p pid="8" id="NN.c35.p8" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="NN.c35.s13"><qs/>'Ay,'<qe/> rejoined Nicholas, taking his arm.</s> <s sid="14" id="NN.c35.s14"><qs/>'Why not?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="9" id="NN.c35.p9" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="NN.c35.s15"><qs/>'I had such hopes once,'<qe/><sss/> said Smike; <sse/><qs/>'day and night, day and night, for many years.</s> <s sid="16" id="NN.c35.s16">I longed for home till I was weary, and pined away with grief, but now--'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="10" id="NN.c35.p10" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="NN.c35.s17"><qs/>'And what now?'<qe/> asked Nicholas, looking kindly in his face.</s> <s sid="18" id="NN.c35.s18"><qs/>'What now, old friend?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="NN.c35.p11" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="NN.c35.s19"><qs/>'I could not part from you to go to any home on earth,'<qe/><sls/> replied Smike, pressing his hand; <sle/><qs/>'except one, except one.</s> <s sid="20" id="NN.c35.s20">I shall never be an old man; and if your hand placed me in the grave, and I could think, before I died, that you would come and look upon it sometimes with one of your kind smiles, and in the summer weather, when everything was alive--not dead like me--I could go to that home almost without a tear.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="12" id="NN.c35.p12" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="NN.c35.s21"><qs/>'Why do you talk thus, poor boy, if your life is a happy one with me?'<qe/> said Nicholas.</s> </p><p pid="13" id="NN.c35.p13" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="NN.c35.s22"><qs/>'Because I should change; not those about me.</s> <s sid="23" id="NN.c35.s23">And if they forgot me, I should never know it,'<qe/> replied Smike.</s> <s sid="24" id="NN.c35.s24"><qs/>'In the churchyard we are all alike, but here there are none like me.</s> <s sid="25" id="NN.c35.s25">I am a poor creature, but I know that.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="NN.c35.p14" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="NN.c35.s26"><qs/>'You are a foolish, silly creature,'<qe/> said Nicholas cheerfully.</s> <s sid="27" id="NN.c35.s27"><qs/>'If that is what you mean, I grant you that.</s> <s sid="28" id="NN.c35.s28">Why, here's a dismal face for ladies' company!--my pretty sister too, whom you have so often asked me about.</s> <s sid="29" id="NN.c35.s29">Is this your Yorkshire gallantry?</s> <s sid="30" id="NN.c35.s30">For shame! for shame!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="NN.c35.p15"><s sid="31" id="NN.c35.s31">Smike brightened up and smiled.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="NN.c35.p16" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="NN.c35.s32"><qs/>'When I talk of home,'<qe/><sss/> pursued Nicholas, <sse/><qs/>'I talk of mine--which is yours of course.</s> <s sid="33" id="NN.c35.s33">If it were defined by any particular four walls and a roof, God knows I should be sufficiently puzzled to say whereabouts it lay; but that is not what I mean.</s> <s sid="34" id="NN.c35.s34">When I speak of home, I speak of the place where--in default of a better--those I love are gathered together; and if that place were a gypsy's tent, or a barn, I should call it by the same good name notwithstanding.</s> <s sid="35" id="NN.c35.s35">And now, for what is my present home, which, however alarming your expectations may be, will neither terrify you by its extent nor its magnificence!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="17" id="NN.c35.p17"><s sid="36" id="NN.c35.s36">So saying, Nicholas took his companion by the arm, and saying a great deal more to the same purpose, and pointing out various things to amuse and interest him as they went along, led the way to Miss La Creevy's house.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="NN.c35.p18" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="NN.c35.s37"><qs/>'And this, Kate,'<qe/><sls/> said Nicholas, entering the room where his sister sat alone, <sle/><qs/>'is the faithful friend and affectionate fellow-traveller whom I prepared you to receive.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="NN.c35.p19"><s sid="38" id="NN.c35.s38">Poor Smike was bashful, and awkward, and frightened enough, at first, but Kate advanced towards him so kindly, and said, in such a sweet voice, how anxious she had been to see him after all her brother had told her, and how much she had to thank him for having comforted Nicholas so greatly in their very trying reverses, that he began to be very doubtful whether he should shed tears or not, and became still more flurried.</s> <s sid="39" id="NN.c35.s39">However, he managed to say, in a broken voice, that Nicholas was his only friend, and that he would lay down his life to help him; and Kate, although she was so kind and considerate, seemed to be so wholly unconscious of his distress and embarrassment, that he recovered almost immediately and felt quite at home.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="NN.c35.p20"><s sid="40" id="NN.c35.s40">Then, Miss La Creevy came in; and to her Smike had to be presented also.</s> <s sid="41" id="NN.c35.s41">And Miss La Creevy was very kind too, and wonderfully talkative: not to Smike, for that would have made him uneasy at first, but to Nicholas and his sister.</s> <s sid="42" id="NN.c35.s42">Then, after a time, she would speak to Smike himself now and then, asking him whether he was a judge of likenesses, and whether he thought that picture in the corner was like herself, and whether he didn't think it would have looked better if she had made herself ten years younger, and whether he didn't think, as a matter of general observation, that young ladies looked better not only in pictures, but out of them too, than old ones; with many more small jokes and facetious remarks, which were delivered with such good-humour and merriment, that Smike thought, within himself, she was the nicest lady he had ever seen; even nicer than Mrs Grudden, of Mr Vincent Crummles's theatre; and she was a nice lady too, and talked, perhaps more, but certainly louder, than Miss La Creevy.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="NN.c35.p21"><s sid="43" id="NN.c35.s43">At length the door opened again, and a lady in mourning came in; and Nicholas kissing the lady in mourning affectionately, and calling her his mother, led her towards the chair from which Smike had risen when she entered the room.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="NN.c35.p22" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="NN.c35.s44"><qs/>'You are always kind-hearted, and anxious to help the oppressed, my dear mother,'<qe/><sss/> said Nicholas, <sse/><qs/>'so you will be favourably disposed towards him, I know.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="NN.c35.p23" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="NN.c35.s45"><qs/>'I am sure, my dear Nicholas,'<qe/> replied Mrs Nickleby, looking very hard at her new friend, and bending to him with something more of majesty than the occasion seemed to require:</s> <s sid="46" id="NN.c35.s46"><qs/>'I am sure any friend of yours has, as indeed he naturally ought to have, and must have, of course, you know, a great claim upon me, and of course, it is a very great pleasure to me to be introduced to anybody you take an interest in.</s> <s sid="47" id="NN.c35.s47">There can he no doubt about that; none at all; not the least in the world,'<qe/> said Mrs Nickleby.</s> <s sid="48" id="NN.c35.s48"><qs/>'At the same time I must say, Nicholas, my dear, as I used to say to your poor dear papa, when he WOULD bring gentlemen home to dinner, and there was nothing in the house, that if he had come the day before yesterday--no, I don't mean the day before yesterday now; I should have said, perhaps, the year before last--we should have been better able to entertain him.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="24" id="NN.c35.p24"><s sid="49" id="NN.c35.s49">With which remarks, Mrs Nickleby turned to her daughter, and inquired, in an audible whisper, whether the gentleman was going to stop all night.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="NN.c35.p25" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="NN.c35.s50"><qs/>'Because, if he is, Kate, my dear,'<qe/><sss/> said Mrs Nickleby, <sse/><qs/>'I don't see that it's possible for him to sleep anywhere, and that's the truth.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="26" id="NN.c35.p26"><s sid="51" id="NN.c35.s51">Kate stepped gracefully forward, and without any show of annoyance or irritation, breathed a few words into her mother's ear.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="NN.c35.p27" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="NN.c35.s52"><qs/>'La, Kate, my dear,'<qe/><sls/> said Mrs Nickleby, shrinking back, <sle/><qs/>'how you do tickle one!</s> <s sid="53" id="NN.c35.s53">Of course, I understand THAT, my love, without your telling me; and I said the same to Nicholas, and I AM very much pleased.</s> <s sid="54" id="NN.c35.s54">You didn't tell me, Nicholas, my dear,'<qe/><sls/> added Mrs Nickleby, turning round with an air of less reserve than she had before assumed, <sle/><qs/>'what your friend's name is.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="28" id="NN.c35.p28" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="NN.c35.s55"><qs/>'His name, mother,'<qe/><sss/> replied Nicholas, <sse/><qs/>'is Smike.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="29" id="NN.c35.p29"><s sid="56" id="NN.c35.s56">The effect of this communication was by no means anticipated; but the name was no sooner pronounced, than Mrs Nickleby dropped upon a chair, and burst into a fit of crying.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="NN.c35.p30" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="NN.c35.s57"><qs/>'What is the matter?'<qe/> exclaimed Nicholas, running to support her.</s> </p><p pid="31" id="NN.c35.p31" type="speech"><s sid="58" id="NN.c35.s58"><qs/>'It's so like Pyke,'<qe/><sss/> cried Mrs Nickleby; <sse/><qs/>'so exactly like Pyke.</s> <s sid="59" id="NN.c35.s59">Oh! don't speak to me--I shall be better presently.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="32" id="NN.c35.p32"><s sid="60" id="NN.c35.s60">And after exhibiting every symptom of slow suffocation in all its stages, and drinking about a tea-spoonful of water from a full tumbler, and spilling the remainder, Mrs Nickleby WAS better, and remarked, with a feeble smile, that she was very foolish, she knew.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="NN.c35.p33" type="speech"><s sid="61" id="NN.c35.s61"><qs/>'It's a weakness in our family,'<qe/><sss/> said Mrs Nickleby, <sse/><qs/>'so, of course, I can't be blamed for it.</s> <s sid="62" id="NN.c35.s62">Your grandmama, Kate, was exactly the same--precisely.</s> <s sid="63" id="NN.c35.s63">The least excitement, the slightest surprise--she fainted away directly.</s> <s sid="64" id="NN.c35.s64">I have heard her say, often and often, that when she was a young lady, and before she was married, she was turning a corner into Oxford Street one day, when she ran against her own hairdresser, who, it seems, was escaping from a bear;--the mere suddenness of the encounter made her faint away directly.</s> <s sid="65" id="NN.c35.s65">Wait, though,'<qe/> added Mrs Nickleby, pausing to consider.</s> <s sid="66" id="NN.c35.s66"><qs/>'Let me be sure I'm right.</s> <s sid="67" id="NN.c35.s67">Was it her hairdresser who had escaped from a bear, or was it a bear who had escaped from her hairdresser's?</s> <s sid="68" id="NN.c35.s68">I declare I can't remember just now, but the hairdresser was a very handsome man, I know, and quite a gentleman in his manners; so that it has nothing to do with the point of the story.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="34" id="NN.c35.p34"><s sid="69" id="NN.c35.s69">Mrs Nickleby having fallen imperceptibly into one of her retrospective moods, improved in temper from that moment, and glided, by an easy change of the conversation occasionally, into various other anecdotes, no less remarkable for their strict application to the subject in hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="NN.c35.p35" type="speech"><s sid="70" id="NN.c35.s70"><qs/>'Mr Smike is from Yorkshire, Nicholas, my dear?'<qe/> said Mrs Nickleby, after dinner, and when she had been silent for some time.</s> </p><p pid="36" id="NN.c35.p36" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="NN.c35.s71"><qs/>'Certainly, mother,'<qe/> replied Nicholas.</s> <s sid="72" id="NN.c35.s72"><qs/>'I see you have not forgotten his melancholy history.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="37" id="NN.c35.p37" type="speech"><s sid="73" id="NN.c35.s73"><qs/>'O dear no,'<qe/> cried Mrs Nickleby.</s> <s sid="74" id="NN.c35.s74"><qs/>'Ah! melancholy, indeed.</s> <s sid="75" id="NN.c35.s75">You don't happen, Mr Smike, ever to have dined with the Grimbles of Grimble Hall, somewhere in the North Riding, do you?'<qe/> said the good lady, addressing herself to him.</s> <s sid="76" id="NN.c35.s76"><qs/>'A very proud man, Sir Thomas Grimble, with six grown-up and most lovely daughters, and the finest park in the county.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="38" id="NN.c35.p38" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="NN.c35.s77"><qs/>'My dear mother,'<qe/><sss/> reasoned Nicholas, <sse/><qs/>'do you suppose that the unfortunate outcast of a Yorkshire school was likely to receive many cards of invitation from the nobility and gentry in the neighbourhood?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="39" id="NN.c35.p39" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="NN.c35.s78"><qs/>'Really, my dear, I don't know why it should be so very extraordinary,'<qe/> said Mrs Nickleby.</s> <s sid="79" id="NN.c35.s79"><qs/>'I know that when I was at school, I always went at least twice every half-year to the Hawkinses at Taunton Vale, and they are much richer than the Grimbles, and connected with them in marriage; so you see it's not so very unlikely, after all.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="40" id="NN.c35.p40"><s sid="80" id="NN.c35.s80">Having put down Nicholas in this triumphant manner, Mrs Nickleby was suddenly seized with a forgetfulness of Smike's real name, and an irresistible tendency to call him Mr Slammons; which circumstance she attributed to the remarkable similarity of the two names in point of sound both beginning with an S, and moreover being spelt with an M.  But whatever doubt there might be on this point, there was none as to his being a most excellent listener; which circumstance had considerable influence in placing them on the very best terms, and inducing Mrs Nickleby to express the highest opinion of his general deportment and disposition.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="NN.c35.p41"><s sid="81" id="NN.c35.s81">Thus, the little circle remained, on the most amicable and agreeable footing, until the Monday morning, when Nicholas withdrew himself from it for a short time, seriously to reflect upon the state of his affairs, and to determine, if he could, upon some course of life, which would enable him to support those who were so entirely dependent upon his exertions.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="NN.c35.p42" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="NN.c35.s82">Mr Crummles occurred to him more than once; but although Kate was acquainted with the whole history of his connection with that gentleman, his mother was not; and he foresaw a thousand fretful objections, on her part, to his seeking a livelihood upon the stage.</s> <s sid="83" id="NN.c35.s83">There were graver reasons, too, against his returning to that mode of life.</s> <s sid="84" id="NN.c35.s84">Independently of those arising out of its spare and precarious earnings, and his own internal conviction that he could never hope to aspire to any great distinction, even as a provincial actor, how could he carry his sister from town to town, and place to place, and debar her from any other associates than those with whom he would be compelled, almost without distinction, to mingle?</s> <s sid="85" id="NN.c35.s85"><qs/>'It won't do,'<qe/><sls/> said Nicholas, shaking his head; <sle/><qs/>'I must try something else.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="43" id="NN.c35.p43" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="NN.c35.s86">It was much easier to make this resolution than to carry it into effect.</s> <s sid="87" id="NN.c35.s87">With no greater experience of the world than he had acquired for himself in his short trials; with a sufficient share of headlong rashness and precipitation (qualities not altogether unnatural at his time of life); with a very slender stock of money, and a still more scanty stock of friends; what could he do?</s> <s sid="88" id="NN.c35.s88"><qs/>'Egad!'<qe/><sss/> said Nicholas, <sse/><qs/>'I'll try that Register Office again.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="44" id="NN.c35.p44"><s sid="89" id="NN.c35.s89">He smiled at himself as he walked away with a quick step; for, an instant before, he had been internally blaming his own precipitation.</s> <s sid="90" id="NN.c35.s90">He did not laugh himself out of the intention, however, for on he went: picturing to himself, as he approached the place, all kinds of splendid possibilities, and impossibilities too, for that matter, and thinking himself, perhaps with good reason, very fortunate to be endowed with so buoyant and sanguine a temperament.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="NN.c35.p45"><s sid="91" id="NN.c35.s91">The office looked just the same as when he had left it last, and, indeed, with one or two exceptions, there seemed to be the very same placards in the window that he had seen before.</s> <s sid="92" id="NN.c35.s92">There were the same unimpeachable masters and mistresses in want of virtuous servants, and the same virtuous servants in want of unimpeachable masters and mistresses, and the same magnificent estates for the investment of capital, and the same enormous quantities of capital to be invested in estates, and, in short, the same opportunities of all sorts for people who wanted to make their fortunes.</s> <s sid="93" id="NN.c35.s93">And a most extraordinary proof it was of the national prosperity, that people had not been found to avail themselves of such advantages long ago.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="NN.c35.p46"><s sid="94" id="NN.c35.s94">As Nicholas stopped to look in at the window, an old gentleman happened to stop too; and Nicholas, carrying his eye along the window-panes from left to right in search of some capital-text placard which should be applicable to his own case, caught sight of this old gentleman's figure, and instinctively withdrew his eyes from the window, to observe the same more closely.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="NN.c35.p47"><s sid="95" id="NN.c35.s95">He was a sturdy old fellow in a broad-skirted blue coat, made pretty large, to fit easily, and with no particular waist; his bulky legs clothed in drab breeches and high gaiters, and his head protected by a low-crowned broad-brimmed white hat, such as a wealthy grazier might wear.</s> <s sid="96" id="NN.c35.s96">He wore his coat buttoned; and his dimpled double chin rested in the folds of a white neckerchief--not one of your stiff- starched apoplectic cravats, but a good, easy, old-fashioned white neckcloth that a man might go to bed in and be none the worse for.</s> <s sid="97" id="NN.c35.s97">But what principally attracted the attention of Nicholas was the old gentleman's eye,--never was such a clear, twinkling, honest, merry, happy eye, as that.</s> <s sid="98" id="NN.c35.s98">And there he stood, looking a little upward, with one hand thrust into the breast of his coat, and the other playing with his old-fashioned gold watch-chain: his head thrown a little on one side, and his hat a little more on one side than his head, (but that was evidently accident; not his ordinary way of wearing it,) with such a pleasant smile playing about his mouth, and such a comical expression of mingled slyness, simplicity, kind- heartedness, and good-humour, lighting up his jolly old face, that Nicholas would have been content to have stood there and looked at him until evening, and to have forgotten, meanwhile, that there was such a thing as a soured mind or a crabbed countenance to be met with in the whole wide world.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="NN.c35.p48"><s sid="99" id="NN.c35.s99">But, even a very remote approach to this gratification was not to be made, for although he seemed quite unconscious of having been the subject of observation, he looked casually at Nicholas; and the latter, fearful of giving offence, resumed his scrutiny of the window instantly.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="NN.c35.p49"><s sid="100" id="NN.c35.s100">Still, the old gentleman stood there, glancing from placard to placard, and Nicholas could not forbear raising his eyes to his face again.</s> <s sid="101" id="NN.c35.s101">Grafted upon the quaintness and oddity of his appearance, was something so indescribably engaging, and bespeaking so much worth, and there were so many little lights hovering about the corners of his mouth and eyes, that it was not a mere amusement, but a positive pleasure and delight to look at him.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="NN.c35.p50"><s sid="102" id="NN.c35.s102">This being the case, it is no wonder that the old man caught Nicholas in the fact, more than once.</s> <s sid="103" id="NN.c35.s103">At such times, Nicholas coloured and looked embarrassed: for the truth is, that he had begun to wonder whether the stranger could, by any possibility, be looking for a clerk or secretary; and thinking this, he felt as if the old gentleman must know it.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="NN.c35.p51"><s sid="104" id="NN.c35.s104">Long as all this takes to tell, it was not more than a couple of minutes in passing.</s> <s sid="105" id="NN.c35.s105">As the stranger was moving away, Nicholas caught his eye again, and, in the awkwardness of the moment, stammered out an apology.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 36 Private and confidential; relating to Family Matters.  Showing how Mr Kenwigs underwent violent Agitation, and how Mrs Kenwigs was as well as could be expected</title>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c36.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c36.s1">It might have been seven o'clock in the evening, and it was growing dark in the narrow streets near Golden Square, when Mr Kenwigs sent out for a pair of the cheapest white kid gloves--those at fourteen- pence--and selecting the strongest, which happened to be the right- hand one, walked downstairs with an air of pomp and much excitement, and proceeded to muffle the knob of the street-door knocker therein.</s> <s sid="2" id="NN.c36.s2">Having executed this task with great nicety, Mr Kenwigs pulled the door to, after him, and just stepped across the road to try the effect from the opposite side of the street.</s> <s sid="3" id="NN.c36.s3">Satisfied that nothing could possibly look better in its way, Mr Kenwigs then stepped back again, and calling through the keyhole to Morleena to open the door, vanished into the house, and was seen no longer.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c36.p2"><s sid="4" id="NN.c36.s4">Now, considered as an abstract circumstance, there was no more obvious cause or reason why Mr Kenwigs should take the trouble of muffling this particular knocker, than there would have been for his muffling the knocker of any nobleman or gentleman resident ten miles off; because, for the greater convenience of the numerous lodgers, the street-door always stood wide open, and the knocker was never used at all.</s> <s sid="5" id="NN.c36.s5">The first floor, the second floor, and the third floor, had each a bell of its own.</s> <s sid="6" id="NN.c36.s6">As to the attics, no one ever called on them; if anybody wanted the parlours, they were close at hand, and all he had to do was to walk straight into them; while the kitchen had a separate entrance down the area steps.</s> <s sid="7" id="NN.c36.s7">As a question of mere necessity and usefulness, therefore, this muffling of the knocker was thoroughly incomprehensible.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="NN.c36.p3"><s sid="8" id="NN.c36.s8">But knockers may be muffled for other purposes than those of mere utilitarianism, as, in the present instance, was clearly shown.</s> <s sid="9" id="NN.c36.s9">There are certain polite forms and ceremonies which must be observed in civilised life, or mankind relapse into their original barbarism.</s> <s sid="10" id="NN.c36.s10">No genteel lady was ever yet confined--indeed, no genteel confinement can possibly take place--without the accompanying symbol of a muffled knocker.</s> <s sid="11" id="NN.c36.s11">Mrs Kenwigs was a lady of some pretensions to gentility; Mrs Kenwigs was confined.</s> <s sid="12" id="NN.c36.s12">And, therefore, Mr Kenwigs tied up the silent knocker on the premises in a white kid glove.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="NN.c36.p4" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="NN.c36.s13"><qs/>'I'm not quite certain neither,'<qe/><sls/> said Mr Kenwigs, arranging his shirt-collar, and walking slowly upstairs, <sle/><qs/>'whether, as it's a boy, I won't have it in the papers.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="NN.c36.p5"><s sid="14" id="NN.c36.s14">Pondering upon the advisability of this step, and the sensation it was likely to create in the neighbourhood, Mr Kenwigs betook himself to the sitting-room, where various extremely diminutive articles of clothing were airing on a horse before the fire, and Mr Lumbey, the doctor, was dandling the baby--that is, the old baby--not the new one.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NN.c36.p6" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="NN.c36.s15"><qs/>'It's a fine boy, Mr Kenwigs,'<qe/> said Mr Lumbey, the doctor.</s> </p><p pid="7" id="NN.c36.p7" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="NN.c36.s16"><qs/>'You consider him a fine boy, do you, sir?'<qe/> returned Mr Kenwigs.</s> </p><p pid="8" id="NN.c36.p8" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="NN.c36.s17"><qs/>'It's the finest boy I ever saw in all my life,'<qe/> said the doctor.</s> <s sid="18" id="NN.c36.s18"><qs/>'I never saw such a baby.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="9" id="NN.c36.p9"><s sid="19" id="NN.c36.s19">It is a pleasant thing to reflect upon, and furnishes a complete answer to those who contend for the gradual degeneration of the human species, that every baby born into the world is a finer one than the last.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="NN.c36.p14" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="NN.c36.s26"><qs/>'She will be a treasure to the man she marries, sir,'<qe/><sls/> said Mr Kenwigs, half aside; <sle/><qs/>'I think she'll marry above her station, Mr Lumbey.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="NN.c36.p15" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="NN.c36.s27"><qs/>'I shouldn't wonder at all,'<qe/> replied the doctor.</s> </p><p pid="16" id="NN.c36.p16" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="NN.c36.s28"><qs/>'You never see her dance, sir, did you?'<qe/> asked Mr Kenwigs.</s> </p><p pid="17" id="NN.c36.p17"><s sid="29" id="NN.c36.s29">The doctor shook his head.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="NN.c36.p18" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="NN.c36.s30"><qs/>'Ay!'<qe/><sls/> said Mr Kenwigs, as though he pitied him from his heart, <sle/><qs/>'then you don't know what she's capable of.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="NN.c36.p19"><s sid="31" id="NN.c36.s31">All this time there had been a great whisking in and out of the other room; the door had been opened and shut very softly about twenty times a minute (for it was necessary to keep Mrs Kenwigs quiet); and the baby had been exhibited to a score or two of deputations from a select body of female friends, who had assembled in the passage, and about the street-door, to discuss the event in all its bearings.</s> <s sid="32" id="NN.c36.s32">Indeed, the excitement extended itself over the whole street, and groups of ladies might be seen standing at the doors, (some in the interesting condition in which Mrs Kenwigs had last appeared in public,) relating their experiences of similar occurrences.</s> <s sid="33" id="NN.c36.s33">Some few acquired great credit from having prophesied, the day before yesterday, exactly when it would come to pass; others, again, related, how that they guessed what it was, directly they saw Mr Kenwigs turn pale and run up the street as hard as ever he could go.</s> <s sid="34" id="NN.c36.s34">Some said one thing, and some another; but all talked together, and all agreed upon two points: first, that it was very meritorious and highly praiseworthy in Mrs Kenwigs to do as she had done: and secondly, that there never was such a skilful and scientific doctor as that Dr Lumbey.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="NN.c36.p20"><s sid="35" id="NN.c36.s35">In the midst of this general hubbub, Dr Lumbey sat in the first- floor front, as before related, nursing the deposed baby, and talking to Mr Kenwigs.</s> <s sid="36" id="NN.c36.s36">He was a stout bluff-looking gentleman, with no shirt-collar to speak of, and a beard that had been growing since yesterday morning; for Dr Lumbey was popular, and the neighbourhood was prolific; and there had been no less than three other knockers muffled, one after the other within the last forty-eight hours.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c37.p2"><s sid="2" id="NN.c37.s2">And let not those whose eyes have been accustomed to the aristocratic gravity of Grosvenor Square and Hanover Square, the dowager barrenness and frigidity of Fitzroy Square, or the gravel walks and garden seats of the Squares of Russell and Euston, suppose that the affections of Tim Linkinwater, or the inferior lovers of this particular locality, had been awakened and kept alive by any refreshing associations with leaves, however dingy, or grass, however bare and thin.</s> <s sid="3" id="NN.c37.s3">The city square has no enclosure, save the lamp-post in the middle: and no grass, but the weeds which spring up round its base.</s> <s sid="4" id="NN.c37.s4">It is a quiet, little-frequented, retired spot, favourable to melancholy and contemplation, and appointments of long-waiting; and up and down its every side the Appointed saunters idly by the hour together wakening the echoes with the monotonous sound of his footsteps on the smooth worn stones, and counting, first the windows, and then the very bricks of the tall silent houses that hem him round about.</s> <s sid="5" id="NN.c37.s5">In winter-time, the snow will linger there, long after it has melted from the busy streets and highways.</s> <s sid="6" id="NN.c37.s6">The summer's sun holds it in some respect, and while he darts his cheerful rays sparingly into the square, keeps his fiery heat and glare for noisier and less-imposing precincts.</s> <s sid="7" id="NN.c37.s7">It is so quiet, that you can almost hear the ticking of your own watch when you stop to cool in its refreshing atmosphere.</s> <s sid="8" id="NN.c37.s8">There is a distant hum--of coaches, not of insects--but no other sound disturbs the stillness of the square.</s> <s sid="9" id="NN.c37.s9">The ticket porter leans idly against the post at the corner: comfortably warm, but not hot, although the day is broiling.</s> <s sid="10" id="NN.c37.s10">His white apron flaps languidly in the air, his head gradually droops upon his breast, he takes very long winks with both eyes at once; even he is unable to withstand the soporific influence of the place, and is gradually falling asleep.</s> <s sid="11" id="NN.c37.s11">But now, he starts into full wakefulness, recoils a step or two, and gazes out before him with eager wildness in his eye.</s> <s sid="12" id="NN.c37.s12">Is it a job, or a boy at marbles?</s> <s sid="13" id="NN.c37.s13">Does he see a ghost, or hear an organ?</s> <s sid="14" id="NN.c37.s14">No; sight more unwonted still--there is a butterfly in the square--a real, live butterfly! astray from flowers and sweets, and fluttering among the iron heads of the dusty area railings.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="NN.c37.p3" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="NN.c37.s15">But if there were not many matters immediately without the doors of Cheeryble Brothers, to engage the attention or distract the thoughts of the young clerk, there were not a few within, to interest and amuse him.</s> <s sid="16" id="NN.c37.s16">There was scarcely an object in the place, animate or inanimate, which did not partake in some degree of the scrupulous method and punctuality of Mr Timothy Linkinwater.</s> <s sid="17" id="NN.c37.s17">Punctual as the counting-house dial, which he maintained to be the best time-keeper in London next after the clock of some old, hidden, unknown church hard by, (for Tim held the fabled goodness of that at the Horse Guards to be a pleasant fiction, invented by jealous West-enders,) the old clerk performed the minutest actions of the day, and arranged the minutest articles in the little room, in a precise and regular order, which could not have been exceeded if it had actually been a real glass case, fitted with the choicest curiosities.</s> <s sid="18" id="NN.c37.s18">Paper, pens, ink, ruler, sealing-wax, wafers, pounce-box, string- box, fire-box, Tim's hat, Tim's scrupulously-folded gloves, Tim's other coat--looking precisely like a back view of himself as it hung against the wall--all had their accustomed inches of space.</s> <s sid="19" id="NN.c37.s19">Except the clock, there was not such an accurate and unimpeachable instrument in existence as the little thermometer which hung behind the door.</s> <s sid="20" id="NN.c37.s20">There was not a bird of such methodical and business-like habits in all the world, as the blind blackbird, who dreamed and dozed away his days in a large snug cage, and had lost his voice, from old age, years before Tim first bought him.</s> <s sid="21" id="NN.c37.s21">There was not such an eventful story in the whole range of anecdote, as Tim could tell concerning the acquisition of that very bird; how, compassionating his starved and suffering condition, he had purchased him, with the view of humanely terminating his wretched life; how he determined to wait three days and see whether the bird revived; how, before half the time was out, the bird did revive; and how he went on reviving and picking up his appetite and good looks until he gradually became what--<qs/>'what you see him now, sir,'<qe/>--Tim would say, glancing proudly at the cage.</s> <s sid="22" id="NN.c37.s22">And with that, Tim would utter a melodious chirrup, and cry <qs/>'Dick;'<qe/> and Dick, who, for any sign of life he had previously given, might have been a wooden or stuffed representation of a blackbird indifferently executed, would come to the side of the cage in three small jumps, and, thrusting his bill between the bars, turn his sightless head towards his old master--and at that moment it would be very difficult to determine which of the two was the happier, the bird or Tim Linkinwater.</s> </p><p pid="4" id="NN.c37.p4"><s sid="23" id="NN.c37.s23">Nor was this all.</s> <s sid="24" id="NN.c37.s24">Everything gave back, besides, some reflection of the kindly spirit of the brothers.</s> <s sid="25" id="NN.c37.s25">The warehousemen and porters were such sturdy, jolly fellows, that it was a treat to see them.</s> <s sid="26" id="NN.c37.s26">Among the shipping announcements and steam-packet list's which decorated the counting-house wall, were designs for almshouses, statements of charities, and plans for new hospitals.</s> <s sid="27" id="NN.c37.s27">A blunderbuss and two swords hung above the chimney-piece, for the terror of evil- doers, but the blunderbuss was rusty and shattered, and the swords were broken and edgeless.</s> <s sid="28" id="NN.c37.s28">Elsewhere, their open display in such a condition would have realised a smile; but, there, it seemed as though even violent and offensive weapons partook of the reigning influence, and became emblems of mercy and forbearance.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="NN.c37.p5"><s sid="29" id="NN.c37.s29">Such thoughts as these occurred to Nicholas very strongly, on the morning when he first took possession of the vacant stool, and looked about him, more freely and at ease, than he had before enjoyed an opportunity of doing.</s> <s sid="30" id="NN.c37.s30">Perhaps they encouraged and stimulated him to exertion, for, during the next two weeks, all his spare hours, late at night and early in the morning, were incessantly devoted to acquiring the mysteries of book-keeping and some other forms of mercantile account.</s> <s sid="31" id="NN.c37.s31">To these, he applied himself with such steadiness and perseverance that, although he brought no greater amount of previous knowledge to the subject than certain dim recollections of two or three very long sums entered into a ciphering-book at school, and relieved for parental inspection by the effigy of a fat swan tastefully flourished by the writing-master's own hand, he found himself, at the end of a fortnight, in a condition to report his proficiency to Mr Linkinwater, and to claim his promise that he, Nicholas Nickleby, should now be allowed to assist him in his graver labours.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NN.c37.p6"><s sid="32" id="NN.c37.s32">It was a sight to behold Tim Linkinwater slowly bring out a massive ledger and day-book, and, after turning them over and over, and affectionately dusting their backs and sides, open the leaves here and there, and cast his eyes, half mournfully, half proudly, upon the fair and unblotted entries.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="NN.c37.p7" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="NN.c37.s33"><qs/>'Four-and-forty year, next May!'<qe/> said Tim.</s> <s sid="34" id="NN.c37.s34"><qs/>'Many new ledgers since then.</s> <s sid="35" id="NN.c37.s35">Four-and-forty year!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="8" id="NN.c37.p8"><s sid="36" id="NN.c37.s36">Tim closed the book again.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="NN.c37.p9" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="NN.c37.s37"><qs/>'Come, come,'<qe/><sss/> said Nicholas, <sse/><qs/>'I am all impatience to begin.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="10" id="NN.c37.p10"><s sid="38" id="NN.c37.s38">Tim Linkinwater shook his head with an air of mild reproof.</s> <s sid="39" id="NN.c37.s39">Mr Nickleby was not sufficiently impressed with the deep and awful nature of his undertaking.</s> <s sid="40" id="NN.c37.s40">Suppose there should be any mistake--any scratching out!</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="NN.c37.p11"><s sid="41" id="NN.c37.s41">Young men are adventurous.</s> <s sid="42" id="NN.c37.s42">It is extraordinary what they will rush upon, sometimes.</s> <s sid="43" id="NN.c37.s43">Without even taking the precaution of sitting himself down upon his stool, but standing leisurely at the desk, and with a smile upon his face--actually a smile--there was no mistake about it; Mr Linkinwater often mentioned it afterwards--Nicholas dipped his pen into the inkstand before him, and plunged into the books of Cheeryble Brothers!</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="NN.c37.p12"><s sid="44" id="NN.c37.s44">Tim Linkinwater turned pale, and tilting up his stool on the two legs nearest Nicholas, looked over his shoulder in breathless anxiety.</s> <s sid="45" id="NN.c37.s45">Brother Charles and brother Ned entered the counting-house together; but Tim Linkinwater, without looking round, impatiently waved his hand as a caution that profound silence must be observed, and followed the nib of the inexperienced pen with strained and eager eyes.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="NN.c37.p13" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="NN.c37.s46">The brothers looked on with smiling faces, but Tim Linkinwater smiled not, nor moved for some minutes.</s> <s sid="47" id="NN.c37.s47">At length, he drew a long slow breath, and still maintaining his position on the tilted stool, glanced at brother Charles, secretly pointed with the feather of his pen towards Nicholas, and nodded his head in a grave and resolute manner, plainly signifying <qs/>'He'll do.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="NN.c37.p14"><s sid="48" id="NN.c37.s48">Brother Charles nodded again, and exchanged a laughing look with brother Ned; but, just then, Nicholas stopped to refer to some other page, and Tim Linkinwater, unable to contain his satisfaction any longer, descended from his stool, and caught him rapturously by the hand.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="NN.c37.p15" type="speech"><s sid="49" id="NN.c37.s49"><qs/>'He has done it!'<qe/> said Tim, looking round at his employers and shaking his head triumphantly.</s> <s sid="50" id="NN.c37.s50"><qs/>'His capital B's and D's are exactly like mine; he dots all his small i's and crosses every t as he writes it.</s> <s sid="51" id="NN.c37.s51">There an't such a young man as this in all London,'<qe/><sls/> said Tim, clapping Nicholas on the back; <sle/><qs/>'not one.</s> <s sid="52" id="NN.c37.s52">Don't tell me!</s> <s sid="53" id="NN.c37.s53">The city can't produce his equal.</s> <s sid="54" id="NN.c37.s54">I challenge the city to do it!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="16" id="NN.c37.p16"><s sid="55" id="NN.c37.s55">With this casting down of his gauntlet, Tim Linkinwater struck the desk such a blow with his clenched fist, that the old blackbird tumbled off his perch with the start it gave him, and actually uttered a feeble croak, in the extremity of his astonishment.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="NN.c37.p27" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="NN.c37.s91">At a quarter past five o'clock, punctual to the minute, arrived, according to annual usage, Tim Linkinwater's sister; and a great to- do there was, between Tim Linkinwater's sister and the old housekeeper, respecting Tim Linkinwater's sister's cap, which had been dispatched, per boy, from the house of the family where Tim Linkinwater's sister boarded, and had not yet come to hand: notwithstanding that it had been packed up in a bandbox, and the bandbox in a handkerchief, and the handkerchief tied on to the boy's arm; and notwithstanding, too, that the place of its consignment had been duly set forth, at full length, on the back of an old letter, and the boy enjoined, under pain of divers horrible penalties, the full extent of which the eye of man could not foresee, to deliver the same with all possible speed, and not to loiter by the way.</s> <s sid="92" id="NN.c37.s92">Tim Linkinwater's sister lamented; the housekeeper condoled; and both kept thrusting their heads out of the second-floor window to see if the boy was <qs/>'coming'<qe/>--which would have been highly satisfactory, and, upon the whole, tantamount to his being come, as the distance to the corner was not quite five yards--when, all of a sudden, and when he was least expected, the messenger, carrying the bandbox with elaborate caution, appeared in an exactly opposite direction, puffing and panting for breath, and flushed with recent exercise; as well he might be; for he had taken the air, in the first instance, behind a hackney coach that went to Camberwell, and had followed two Punches afterwards and had seen the Stilts home to their own door.</s> <s sid="93" id="NN.c37.s93">The cap was all safe, however--that was one comfort--and it was no use scolding him--that was another; so the boy went upon his way rejoicing, and Tim Linkinwater's sister presented herself to the company below-stairs, just five minutes after the half-hour had struck by Tim Linkinwater's own infallible clock.</s> </p><p pid="28" id="NN.c37.p28"><s sid="94" id="NN.c37.s94">The company consisted of the brothers Cheeryble, Tim Linkinwater, a ruddy-faced white-headed friend of Tim's (who was a superannuated bank clerk), and Nicholas, who was presented to Tim Linkinwater's sister with much gravity and solemnity.</s> <s sid="95" id="NN.c37.s95">The party being now completed, brother Ned rang for dinner, and, dinner being shortly afterwards announced, led Tim Linkinwater's sister into the next room, where it was set forth with great preparation.</s> <s sid="96" id="NN.c37.s96">Then, brother Ned took the head of the table, and brother Charles the foot; and Tim Linkinwater's sister sat on the left hand of brother Ned, and Tim Linkinwater himself on his right: and an ancient butler of apoplectic appearance, and with very short legs, took up his position at the back of brother Ned's armchair, and, waving his right arm preparatory to taking off the covers with a flourish, stood bolt upright and motionless.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 41 Containing some Romantic Passages between Mrs Nickleby and the Gentleman in the Small-clothes next Door</title>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c41.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c41.s1">Ever since her last momentous conversation with her son, Mrs Nickleby had begun to display unusual care in the adornment of her person, gradually superadding to those staid and matronly habiliments, which had, up to that time, formed her ordinary attire, a variety of embellishments and decorations, slight perhaps in themselves, but, taken together, and considered with reference to the subject of her disclosure, of no mean importance.</s> <s sid="2" id="NN.c41.s2">Even her black dress assumed something of a deadly-lively air from the jaunty style in which it was worn; and, eked out as its lingering attractions were; by a prudent disposal, here and there, of certain juvenile ornaments of little or no value, which had, for that reason alone, escaped the general wreck and been permitted to slumber peacefully in odd corners of old drawers and boxes where daylight seldom shone, her mourning garments assumed quite a new character.</s> <s sid="3" id="NN.c41.s3">From being the outward tokens of respect and sorrow for the dead, they became converted into signals of very slaughterous and killing designs upon the living.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c41.p2"><s sid="4" id="NN.c41.s4">Mrs Nickleby might have been stimulated to this proceeding by a lofty sense of duty, and impulses of unquestionable excellence.</s> <s sid="5" id="NN.c41.s5">She might, by this time, have become impressed with the sinfulness of long indulgence in unavailing woe, or the necessity of setting a proper example of neatness and decorum to her blooming daughter.</s> <s sid="6" id="NN.c41.s6">Considerations of duty and responsibility apart, the change might have taken its rise in feelings of the purest and most disinterested charity.</s> <s sid="7" id="NN.c41.s7">The gentleman next door had been vilified by Nicholas; rudely stigmatised as a dotard and an idiot; and for these attacks upon his understanding, Mrs Nickleby was, in some sort, accountable.</s> <s sid="8" id="NN.c41.s8">She might have felt that it was the act of a good Christian to show by all means in her power, that the abused gentleman was neither the one nor the other.</s> <s sid="9" id="NN.c41.s9">And what better means could she adopt, towards so virtuous and laudable an end, than proving to all men, in her own person, that his passion was the most rational and reasonable in the world, and just the very result, of all others, which discreet and thinking persons might have foreseen, from her incautiously displaying her matured charms, without reserve, under the very eye, as it were, of an ardent and too-susceptible man?</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="NN.c41.p3" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="NN.c41.s10"><qs/>'Ah!'<qe/><sls/> said Mrs Nickleby, gravely shaking her head; <sle/><qs/>'if Nicholas knew what his poor dear papa suffered before we were engaged, when I used to hate him, he would have a little more feeling.</s> <s sid="11" id="NN.c41.s11">Shall I ever forget the morning I looked scornfully at him when he offered to carry my parasol?</s> <s sid="12" id="NN.c41.s12">Or that night, when I frowned at him?</s> <s sid="13" id="NN.c41.s13">It was a mercy he didn't emigrate.</s> <s sid="14" id="NN.c41.s14">It very nearly drove him to it.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="4" id="NN.c41.p4"><s sid="15" id="NN.c41.s15">Whether the deceased might not have been better off if he had emigrated in his bachelor days, was a question which his relict did not stop to consider; for Kate entered the room, with her workbox, in this stage of her reflections; and a much slighter interruption, or no interruption at all, would have diverted Mrs Nickleby's thoughts into a new channel at any time.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c43.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c43.s1">The storm had long given place to a calm the most profound, and the evening was pretty far advanced--indeed supper was over, and the process of digestion proceeding as favourably as, under the influence of complete tranquillity, cheerful conversation, and a moderate allowance of brandy-and-water, most wise men conversant with the anatomy and functions of the human frame will consider that it ought to have proceeded, when the three friends, or as one might say, both in a civil and religious sense, and with proper deference and regard to the holy state of matrimony, the two friends, (Mr and Mrs Browdie counting as no more than one,) were startled by the noise of loud and angry threatenings below stairs, which presently attained so high a pitch, and were conveyed besides in language so towering, sanguinary, and ferocious, that it could hardly have been surpassed, if there had actually been a Saracen's head then present in the establishment, supported on the shoulders and surmounting the trunk of a real, live, furious, and most unappeasable Saracen.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c43.p2" type="speech"><s sid="2" id="NN.c43.s2">This turmoil, instead of quickly subsiding after the first outburst, (as turmoils not unfrequently do, whether in taverns, legislative assemblies, or elsewhere,) into a mere grumbling and growling squabble, increased every moment; and although the whole din appeared to be raised by but one pair of lungs, yet that one pair was of so powerful a quality, and repeated such words as <qs/>'scoundrel,'<qe/><sss/> 'rascal,' <sse/><qs/>'insolent puppy,'<qe/> and a variety of expletives no less flattering to the party addressed, with such great relish and strength of tone, that a dozen voices raised in concert under any ordinary circumstances would have made far less uproar and created much smaller consternation.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="NN.c43.p3" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="NN.c43.s3"><qs/>'Why, what's the matter?'<qe/> said Nicholas, moving hastily towards the door.</s> </p><p pid="4" id="NN.c43.p4"><s sid="4" id="NN.c43.s4">John Browdie was striding in the same direction when Mrs Browdie turned pale, and, leaning back in her chair, requested him with a faint voice to take notice, that if he ran into any danger it was her intention to fall into hysterics immediately, and that the consequences might be more serious than he thought for.</s> <s sid="5" id="NN.c43.s5">John looked rather disconcerted by this intelligence, though there was a lurking grin on his face at the same time; but, being quite unable to keep out of the fray, he compromised the matter by tucking his wife's arm under his own, and, thus accompanied, following Nicholas downstairs with all speed.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="NN.c43.p5"><s sid="6" id="NN.c43.s6">The passage outside the coffee-room door was the scene of disturbance, and here were congregated the coffee-room customers and waiters, together with two or three coachmen and helpers from the yard.</s> <s sid="7" id="NN.c43.s7">These had hastily assembled round a young man who from his appearance might have been a year or two older than Nicholas, and who, besides having given utterance to the defiances just now described, seemed to have proceeded to even greater lengths in his indignation, inasmuch as his feet had no other covering than a pair of stockings, while a couple of slippers lay at no great distance from the head of a prostrate figure in an opposite corner, who bore the appearance of having been shot into his present retreat by means of a kick, and complimented by having the slippers flung about his ears afterwards.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NN.c43.p6"><s sid="8" id="NN.c43.s8">The coffee-room customers, and the waiters, and the coachmen, and the helpers--not to mention a barmaid who was looking on from behind an open sash window--seemed at that moment, if a spectator might judge from their winks, nods, and muttered exclamations, strongly disposed to take part against the young gentleman in the stockings.</s> <s sid="9" id="NN.c43.s9">Observing this, and that the young gentleman was nearly of his own age and had in nothing the appearance of an habitual brawler, Nicholas, impelled by such feelings as will influence young men sometimes, felt a very strong disposition to side with the weaker party, and so thrust himself at once into the centre of the group, and in a more emphatic tone, perhaps, than circumstances might seem to warrant, demanded what all that noise was about.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="NN.c43.p39"><s sid="69" id="NN.c43.s69">This Mr Frank Cheeryble, although, to judge from what had recently taken place, a hot-headed young man (which is not an absolute miracle and phenomenon in nature), was a sprightly, good-humoured, pleasant fellow, with much both in his countenance and disposition that reminded Nicholas very strongly of the kind-hearted brothers.</s> <s sid="70" id="NN.c43.s70">His manner was as unaffected as theirs, and his demeanour full of that heartiness which, to most people who have anything generous in their composition, is peculiarly prepossessing.</s> <s sid="71" id="NN.c43.s71">Add to this, that he was good-looking and intelligent, had a plentiful share of vivacity, was extremely cheerful, and accommodated himself in five minutes' time to all John Browdie's oddities with as much ease as if he had known him from a boy; and it will be a source of no great wonder that, when they parted for the night, he had produced a most favourable impression, not only upon the worthy Yorkshireman and his wife, but upon Nicholas also, who, revolving all these things in his mind as he made the best of his way home, arrived at the conclusion that he had laid the foundation of a most agreeable and desirable acquaintance.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="NN.c43.p42"><s sid="82" id="NN.c43.s82">Here was Nicholas Nickleby, who would have scorned the thought of counting how the chances stood of his rising in favour or fortune with the brothers Cheeryble, now that their nephew had returned, already deep in calculations whether that same nephew was likely to rival him in the affections of the fair unknown--discussing the matter with himself too, as gravely as if, with that one exception, it were all settled; and recurring to the subject again and again, and feeling quite indignant and ill-used at the notion of anybody else making love to one with whom he had never exchanged a word in all his life.</s> <s sid="83" id="NN.c43.s83">To be sure, he exaggerated rather than depreciated the merits of his new acquaintance; but still he took it as a kind of personal offence that he should have any merits at all--in the eyes of this particular young lady, that is; for elsewhere he was quite welcome to have as many as he pleased.</s> <s sid="84" id="NN.c43.s84">There was undoubted selfishness in all this, and yet Nicholas was of a most free and generous nature, with as few mean or sordid thoughts, perhaps, as ever fell to the lot of any man; and there is no reason to suppose that, being in love, he felt and thought differently from other people in the like sublime condition.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="NN.c43.p43"><s sid="85" id="NN.c43.s85">He did not stop to set on foot an inquiry into his train of thought or state of feeling, however; but went thinking on all the way home, and continued to dream on in the same strain all night.</s> <s sid="86" id="NN.c43.s86">For, having satisfied himself that Frank Cheeryble could have no knowledge of, or acquaintance with, the mysterious young lady, it began to occur to him that even he himself might never see her again; upon which hypothesis he built up a very ingenious succession of tormenting ideas which answered his purpose even better than the vision of Mr Frank Cheeryble, and tantalised and worried him, waking and sleeping.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="NN.c43.p44"><s sid="87" id="NN.c43.s87">Notwithstanding all that has been said and sung to the contrary, there is no well-established case of morning having either deferred or hastened its approach by the term of an hour or so for the mere gratification of a splenetic feeling against some unoffending lover: the sun having, in the discharge of his public duty, as the books of precedent report, invariably risen according to the almanacs, and without suffering himself to be swayed by any private considerations.</s> <s sid="88" id="NN.c43.s88">So, morning came as usual, and with it business-hours, and with them Mr Frank Cheeryble, and with him a long train of smiles and welcomes from the worthy brothers, and a more grave and clerk-like, but scarcely less hearty reception from Mr Timothy Linkinwater.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="NN.c45.p3"><s sid="3" id="NN.c45.s3">The time at which John found himself in this enviable condition was the same evening to which the last chapter bore reference; the place was the cottage; and the assembled company were Nicholas, Mrs Nickleby, Mrs Browdie, Kate Nickleby, and Smike.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="NN.c45.p4"><s sid="4" id="NN.c45.s4">A very merry party they had been.</s> <s sid="5" id="NN.c45.s5">Mrs Nickleby, knowing of her son's obligations to the honest Yorkshireman, had, after some demur, yielded her consent to Mr and Mrs Browdie being invited out to tea; in the way of which arrangement, there were at first sundry difficulties and obstacles, arising out of her not having had an opportunity of 'calling' upon Mrs Browdie first; for although Mrs Nickleby very often observed with much complacency (as most punctilious people do), that she had not an atom of pride or formality about her, still she was a great stickler for dignity and ceremonies; and as it was manifest that, until a call had been made, she could not be (politely speaking, and according to the laws of society) even cognisant of the fact of Mrs Browdie's existence, she felt her situation to be one of peculiar delicacy and difficulty.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="NN.c45.p5" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="NN.c45.s6"><qs/>'The call MUST originate with me, my dear,'<qe/><sss/> said Mrs Nickleby, <sse/><qs/>'that's indispensable.</s> <s sid="7" id="NN.c45.s7">The fact is, my dear, that it's necessary there should be a sort of condescension on my part, and that I should show this young person that I am willing to take notice of her.</s> <s sid="8" id="NN.c45.s8">There's a very respectable-looking young man,'<qe/><sls/> added Mrs Nickleby, after a short consideration, <sle/><qs/>'who is conductor to one of the omnibuses that go by here, and who wears a glazed hat--your sister and I have noticed him very often--he has a wart upon his nose, Kate, you know, exactly like a gentleman's servant.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="NN.c45.p6" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="NN.c45.s9"><qs/>'Have all gentlemen's servants warts upon their noses, mother?'<qe/> asked Nicholas.</s> </p><p pid="7" id="NN.c45.p7" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="NN.c45.s10"><qs/>'Nicholas, my dear, how very absurd you are,'<qe/><sss/> returned his mother; <sse/><qs/>'of course I mean that his glazed hat looks like a gentleman's servant, and not the wart upon his nose; though even that is not so ridiculous as it may seem to you, for we had a footboy once, who had not only a wart, but a wen also, and a very large wen too, and he demanded to have his wages raised in consequence, because he found it came very expensive.</s> <s sid="11" id="NN.c45.s11">Let me see, what was I--oh yes, I know.</s> <s sid="12" id="NN.c45.s12">The best way that I can think of would be to send a card, and my compliments, (I've no doubt he'd take 'em for a pot of porter,) by this young man, to the Saracen with Two Necks.</s> <s sid="13" id="NN.c45.s13">If the waiter took him for a gentleman's servant, so much the better.</s> <s sid="14" id="NN.c45.s14">Then all Mrs Browdie would have to do would be to send her card back by the carrier (he could easily come with a double knock), and there's an end of it.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="8" id="NN.c45.p8" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="NN.c45.s15"><qs/>'My dear mother,'<qe/><sss/> said Nicholas, <sse/><qs/>'I don't suppose such unsophisticated people as these ever had a card of their own, or ever will have.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="9" id="NN.c45.p9" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="NN.c45.s16"><qs/>'Oh that, indeed, Nicholas, my dear,'<qe/><sss/> returned Mrs Nickleby, <sse/><qs/>'that's another thing.</s> <s sid="17" id="NN.c45.s17">If you put it upon that ground, why, of course, I have no more to say, than that I have no doubt they are very good sort of persons, and that I have no kind of objection to their coming here to tea if they like, and shall make a point of being very civil to them if they do.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="10" id="NN.c45.p10"><s sid="18" id="NN.c45.s18">The point being thus effectually set at rest, and Mrs Nickleby duly placed in the patronising and mildly-condescending position which became her rank and matrimonial years, Mr and Mrs Browdie were invited and came; and as they were very deferential to Mrs Nickleby, and seemed to have a becoming appreciation of her greatness, and were very much pleased with everything, the good lady had more than once given Kate to understand, in a whisper, that she thought they were the very best-meaning people she had ever seen, and perfectly well behaved.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="NN.c45.p11"><s sid="19" id="NN.c45.s19">And thus it came to pass, that John Browdie declared, in the parlour after supper, to wit, and twenty minutes before eleven o'clock p.m., that he had never been so happy in all his days.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="NN.c45.p12" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="NN.c45.s20">Nor was Mrs Browdie much behind her husband in this respect, for that young matron, whose rustic beauty contrasted very prettily with the more delicate loveliness of Kate, and without suffering by the contrast either, for each served as it were to set off and decorate the other, could not sufficiently admire the gentle and winning manners of the young lady, or the engaging affability of the elder one.</s> <s sid="21" id="NN.c45.s21">Then Kate had the art of turning the conversation to subjects upon which the country girl, bashful at first in strange company, could feel herself at home; and if Mrs Nickleby was not quite so felicitous at times in the selection of topics of discourse, or if she did seem, as Mrs Browdie expressed it, <qs/>'rather high in her notions,'<qe/> still nothing could be kinder, and that she took considerable interest in the young couple was manifest from the very long lectures on housewifery with which she was so obliging as to entertain Mrs Browdie's private ear, which were illustrated by various references to the domestic economy of the cottage, in which (those duties falling exclusively upon Kate) the good lady had about as much share, either in theory or practice, as any one of the statues of the Twelve Apostles which embellish the exterior of St Paul's Cathedral.</s> </p><p pid="13" id="NN.c45.p13" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="NN.c45.s22"><qs/>'Mr Browdie,'<qe/><sls/> said Kate, addressing his young wife, <sle/><qs/>'is the best- humoured, the kindest and heartiest creature I ever saw.</s> <s sid="23" id="NN.c45.s23">If I were oppressed with I don't know how many cares, it would make me happy only to look at him.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="NN.c45.p14" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="NN.c45.s24"><qs/>'He does seem indeed, upon my word, a most excellent creature, Kate,'<qe/><sss/> said Mrs Nickleby;

though of course, and it's perfectly clear, and a very happy thing too, I think, that very few young married people can be exposed to such temptations.</s> <s sid="39" id="NN.c45.s39">There was one family in particular, that used to live about a mile from us--not straight down the road, but turning sharp off to the left by the turnpike where the Plymouth mail ran over the donkey--that were quite extraordinary people for giving the most extravagant parties, with artificial flowers and champagne, and variegated lamps, and, in short, every delicacy of eating and drinking that the most singular epicure could possibly require.</s> <s sid="40" id="NN.c45.s40">I don't think that there ever were such people as those Peltiroguses.</s> <s sid="41" id="NN.c45.s41">You remember the Peltiroguses, Kate?'</s> </p><p pid="17" id="NN.c45.p17"><s sid="42" id="NN.c45.s42">Kate saw that for the ease and comfort of the visitors it was high time to stay this flood of recollection, so answered that she entertained of the Peltiroguses a most vivid and distinct remembrance; and then said that Mr Browdie had half promised, early in the evening, that he would sing a Yorkshire song, and that she was most impatient that he should redeem his promise, because she was sure it would afford her mama more amusement and pleasure than it was possible to express.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="NN.c45.p18"><s sid="43" id="NN.c45.s43">Mrs Nickleby confirming her daughter with the best possible grace-- for there was patronage in that too, and a kind of implication that she had a discerning taste in such matters, and was something of a critic--John Browdie proceeded to consider the words of some north- country ditty, and to take his wife's recollection respecting the same.</s> <s sid="44" id="NN.c45.s44">This done, he made divers ungainly movements in his chair, and singling out one particular fly on the ceiling from the other flies there asleep, fixed his eyes upon him, and began to roar a meek sentiment (supposed to be uttered by a gentle swain fast pining away with love and despair) in a voice of thunder.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="NN.c45.p19"><s sid="45" id="NN.c45.s45">At the end of the first verse, as though some person without had waited until then to make himself audible, was heard a loud and violent knocking at the street-door; so loud and so violent, indeed, that the ladies started as by one accord, and John Browdie stopped.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="NN.c45.p22"><s sid="49" id="NN.c45.s49">But a hasty exclamation from Kate stopped her abruptly in her conjectures, and Ralph Nickleby walked into the room.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 48 Being for the Benefit of Mr Vincent Crummles, and positively his last Appearance on this Stage</title>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c48.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c48.s1">It was with a very sad and heavy heart, oppressed by many painful ideas, that Nicholas retraced his steps eastward and betook himself to the counting-house of Cheeryble Brothers.</s> <s sid="2" id="NN.c48.s2">Whatever the idle hopes he had suffered himself to entertain, whatever the pleasant visions which had sprung up in his mind and grouped themselves round the fair image of Madeline Bray, they were now dispelled, and not a vestige of their gaiety and brightness remained.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c48.p2"><s sid="3" id="NN.c48.s3">It would be a poor compliment to Nicholas's better nature, and one which he was very far from deserving, to insinuate that the solution, and such a solution, of the mystery which had seemed to surround Madeline Bray, when he was ignorant even of her name, had damped his ardour or cooled the fervour of his admiration.</s> <s sid="4" id="NN.c48.s4">If he had regarded her before, with such a passion as young men attracted by mere beauty and elegance may entertain, he was now conscious of much deeper and stronger feelings.</s> <s sid="5" id="NN.c48.s5">But, reverence for the truth and purity of her heart, respect for the helplessness and loneliness of her situation, sympathy with the trials of one so young and fair and admiration of her great and noble spirit, all seemed to raise her far above his reach, and, while they imparted new depth and dignity to his love, to whisper that it was hopeless.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="NN.c48.p3" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="NN.c48.s6"><qs/>'I will keep my word, as I have pledged it to her,'<qe/> said Nicholas, manfully.</s> <s sid="7" id="NN.c48.s7"><qs/>'This is no common trust that I have to discharge, and I will perform the double duty that is imposed upon me most scrupulously and strictly.</s> <s sid="8" id="NN.c48.s8">My secret feelings deserve no consideration in such a case as this, and they shall have none.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="4" id="NN.c48.p4"><s sid="9" id="NN.c48.s9">Still, there were the secret feelings in existence just the same, and in secret Nicholas rather encouraged them than otherwise; reasoning (if he reasoned at all) that there they could do no harm to anybody but himself, and that if he kept them to himself from a sense of duty, he had an additional right to entertain himself with them as a reward for his heroism.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="NN.c48.p5"><s sid="10" id="NN.c48.s10">All these thoughts, coupled with what he had seen that morning and the anticipation of his next visit, rendered him a very dull and abstracted companion; so much so, indeed, that Tim Linkinwater suspected he must have made the mistake of a figure somewhere, which was preying upon his mind, and seriously conjured him, if such were the case, to make a clean breast and scratch it out, rather than have his whole life embittered by the tortures of remorse.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NN.c48.p6"><s sid="11" id="NN.c48.s11">But in reply to these considerate representations, and many others both from Tim and Mr Frank, Nicholas could only be brought to state that he was never merrier in his life; and so went on all day, and so went towards home at night, still turning over and over again the same subjects, thinking over and over again the same things, and arriving over and over again at the same conclusions.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c49.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c49.s1">While Nicholas, absorbed in the one engrossing subject of interest which had recently opened upon him, occupied his leisure hours with thoughts of Madeline Bray, and in execution of the commissions which the anxiety of brother Charles in her behalf imposed upon him, saw her again and again, and each time with greater danger to his peace of mind and a more weakening effect upon the lofty resolutions he had formed, Mrs Nickleby and Kate continued to live in peace and quiet, agitated by no other cares than those which were connected with certain harassing proceedings taken by Mr Snawley for the recovery of his son, and their anxiety for Smike himself, whose health, long upon the wane, began to be so much affected by apprehension and uncertainty as sometimes to occasion both them and Nicholas considerable uneasiness, and even alarm.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c49.p2"><s sid="2" id="NN.c49.s2">It was no complaint or murmur on the part of the poor fellow himself that thus disturbed them.</s> <s sid="3" id="NN.c49.s3">Ever eager to be employed in such slight services as he could render, and always anxious to repay his benefactors with cheerful and happy looks, less friendly eyes might have seen in him no cause for any misgiving.</s> <s sid="4" id="NN.c49.s4">But there were times, and often too, when the sunken eye was too bright, the hollow cheek too flushed, the breath too thick and heavy in its course, the frame too feeble and exhausted, to escape their regard and notice.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="NN.c49.p3"><s sid="5" id="NN.c49.s5">There is a dread disease which so prepares its victim, as it were, for death; which so refines it of its grosser aspect, and throws around familiar looks unearthly indications of the coming change; a dread disease, in which the struggle between soul and body is so gradual, quiet, and solemn, and the result so sure, that day by day, and grain by grain, the mortal part wastes and withers away, so that the spirit grows light and sanguine with its lightening load, and, feeling immortality at hand, deems it but a new term of mortal life; a disease in which death and life are so strangely blended, that death takes the glow and hue of life, and life the gaunt and grisly form of death; a disease which medicine never cured, wealth never warded off, or poverty could boast exemption from; which sometimes moves in giant strides, and sometimes at a tardy sluggish pace, but, slow or quick, is ever sure and certain.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="NN.c49.p4"><s sid="6" id="NN.c49.s6">It was with some faint reference in his own mind to this disorder, though he would by no means admit it, even to himself, that Nicholas had already carried his faithful companion to a physician of great repute.</s> <s sid="7" id="NN.c49.s7">There was no cause for immediate alarm, he said.</s> <s sid="8" id="NN.c49.s8">There were no present symptoms which could be deemed conclusive.</s> <s sid="9" id="NN.c49.s9">The constitution had been greatly tried and injured in childhood, but still it MIGHT not be--and that was all.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NN.c49.p6"><s sid="12" id="NN.c49.s12">Many and many a time in after years did Nicholas look back to this period of his life, and tread again the humble quiet homely scenes that rose up as of old before him.</s> <s sid="13" id="NN.c49.s13">Many and many a time, in the twilight of a summer evening, or beside the flickering winter's fire--but not so often or so sadly then--would his thoughts wander back to these old days, and dwell with a pleasant sorrow upon every slight remembrance which they brought crowding home.</s> <s sid="14" id="NN.c49.s14">The little room in which they had so often sat long after it was dark, figuring such happy futures; Kate's cheerful voice and merry laugh; how, if she were from home, they used to sit and watch for her return scarcely breaking silence but to say how dull it seemed without her; the glee with which poor Smike would start from the darkened corner where he used to sit, and hurry to admit her, and the tears they often saw upon his face, half wondering to see them too, and he so pleased and happy; every little incident, and even slight words and looks of those old days little heeded then, but well remembered when busy cares and trials were quite forgotten, came fresh and thick before him many and many a time, and, rustling above the dusty growth of years, came back green boughs of yesterday.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="NN.c49.p41"><s sid="98" id="NN.c49.s98">Kate was commonly the life and soul of the conversation at home; but she was more silent than usual upon this occasion (perhaps because Tim and Miss La Creevy engrossed so much of it), and, keeping aloof from the talkers, sat at the window watching the shadows as the evening closed in, and enjoying the quiet beauty of the night, which seemed to have scarcely less attractions to Frank, who first lingered near, and then sat down beside, her.</s> <s sid="99" id="NN.c49.s99">No doubt, there are a great many things to be said appropriate to a summer evening, and no doubt they are best said in a low voice, as being most suitable to the peace and serenity of the hour; long pauses, too, at times, and then an earnest word or so, and then another interval of silence which, somehow, does not seem like silence either, and perhaps now and then a hasty turning away of the head, or drooping of the eyes towards the ground, all these minor circumstances, with a disinclination to have candles introduced and a tendency to confuse hours with minutes, are doubtless mere influences of the time, as many lovely lips can clearly testify.</s> <s sid="100" id="NN.c49.s100">Neither is there the slightest reason why Mrs Nickleby should have expressed surprise when, candles being at length brought in, Kate's bright eyes were unable to bear the light which obliged her to avert her face, and even to leave the room for some short time; because, when one has sat in the dark so long, candles ARE dazzling, and nothing can be more strictly natural than that such results should be produced, as all well-informed young people know.</s> <s sid="101" id="NN.c49.s101">For that matter, old people know it too, or did know it once, but they forget these things sometimes, and more's the pity.</s> </p>

<p pid="43" id="NN.c49.p43"><s sid="104" id="NN.c49.s104">It being quite plain to the comprehension of all present that, however extraordinary and improbable it might appear, the noise did nevertheless proceed from the chimney in question; and the noise (which was a strange compound of various shuffling, sliding, rumbling, and struggling sounds, all muffled by the chimney) still continuing, Frank Cheeryble caught up a candle, and Tim Linkinwater the tongs, and they would have very quickly ascertained the cause of this disturbance if Mrs Nickleby had not been taken very faint, and declined being left behind, on any account.</s> <s sid="105" id="NN.c49.s105">This produced a short remonstrance, which terminated in their all proceeding to the troubled chamber in a body, excepting only Miss La Creevy, who, as the servant girl volunteered a confession of having been subject to fits in her infancy, remained with her to give the alarm and apply restoratives, in case of extremity.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="NN.c49.p44" type="speech"><s sid="106" id="NN.c49.s106">Advancing to the door of the mysterious apartment, they were not a little surprised to hear a human voice, chanting with a highly elaborated expression of melancholy, and in tones of suffocation which a human voice might have produced from under five or six feather-beds of the best quality, the once popular air of <qs/>'Has she then failed in her truth, the beautiful maid I adore?'<qe/></s> <s sid="107" id="NN.c49.s107">Nor, on bursting into the room without demanding a parley, was their astonishment lessened by the discovery that these romantic sounds certainly proceeded from the throat of some man up the chimney, of whom nothing was visible but a pair of legs, which were dangling above the grate; apparently feeling, with extreme anxiety, for the top bar whereon to effect a landing.</s> </p><p pid="45" id="NN.c49.p45"><s sid="108" id="NN.c49.s108">A sight so unusual and unbusiness-like as this, completely paralysed Tim Linkinwater, who, after one or two gentle pinches at the stranger's ankles, which were productive of no effect, stood clapping the tongs together, as if he were sharpening them for another assault, and did nothing else.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="NN.c52.p32" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="NN.c52.s78"><qs/>'He's a violent youth at times,'<qe/><sls/> said Newman, looking after him; <sle/><qs/>'and yet like him for it.</s> <s sid="79" id="NN.c52.s79">There's cause enough now, or the deuce is in it.</s> <s sid="80" id="NN.c52.s80">Hope!</s> <s sid="81" id="NN.c52.s81">I SAID hope, I think!</s> <s sid="82" id="NN.c52.s82">Ralph Nickleby and Gride with their heads together!</s> <s sid="83" id="NN.c52.s83">And hope for the opposite party!</s> <s sid="84" id="NN.c52.s84">Ho! ho!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="33" id="NN.c52.p33"><s sid="85" id="NN.c52.s85">It was with a very melancholy laugh that Newman Noggs concluded this soliloquy; and it was with a very melancholy shake of the head, and a very rueful countenance, that he turned about, and went plodding on his way.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="NN.c52.p34"><s sid="86" id="NN.c52.s86">This, under ordinary circumstances, would have been to some small tavern or dram-shop; that being his way, in more senses than one.</s> <s sid="87" id="NN.c52.s87">But, Newman was too much interested, and too anxious, to betake himself even to this resource, and so, with many desponding and dismal reflections, went straight home.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="NN.c52.p35"><s sid="88" id="NN.c52.s88">It had come to pass, that afternoon, that Miss Morleena Kenwigs had received an invitation to repair next day, per steamer from Westminster Bridge, unto the Eel-pie Island at Twickenham: there to make merry upon a cold collation, bottled beer, shrub, and shrimps, and to dance in the open air to the music of a locomotive band, conveyed thither for the purpose: the steamer being specially engaged by a dancing-master of extensive connection for the accommodation of his numerous pupils, and the pupils displaying their appreciation of the dancing-master's services, by purchasing themselves, and inducing their friends to do the like, divers light- blue tickets, entitling them to join the expedition.</s> <s sid="89" id="NN.c52.s89">Of these light- blue tickets, one had been presented by an ambitious neighbour to Miss Morleena Kenwigs, with an invitation to join her daughters; and Mrs Kenwigs, rightly deeming that the honour of the family was involved in Miss Morleena's making the most splendid appearance possible on so short a notice, and testifying to the dancing-master that there were other dancing-masters besides him, and to all fathers and mothers present that other people's children could learn to be genteel besides theirs, had fainted away twice under the magnitude of her preparations, but, upheld by a determination to sustain the family name or perish in the attempt, was still hard at work when Newman Noggs came home.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="NN.c52.p36"><s sid="90" id="NN.c52.s90">Now, between the italian-ironing of frills, the flouncing of trousers, the trimming of frocks, the faintings and the comings-to again, incidental to the occasion, Mrs Kenwigs had been so entirely occupied, that she had not observed, until within half an hour before, that the flaxen tails of Miss Morleena's hair were, in a manner, run to seed; and that, unless she were put under the hands of a skilful hairdresser, she never could achieve that signal triumph over the daughters of all other people, anything less than which would be tantamount to defeat.</s> <s sid="91" id="NN.c52.s91">This discovery drove Mrs Kenwigs to despair; for the hairdresser lived three streets and eight dangerous crossings off; Morleena could not be trusted to go there alone, even if such a proceeding were strictly proper: of which Mrs Kenwigs had her doubts; Mr Kenwigs had not returned from business; and there was nobody to take her.</s> <s sid="92" id="NN.c52.s92">So, Mrs Kenwigs first slapped Miss Kenwigs for being the cause of her vexation, and then shed tears.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="NN.c52.p37" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="NN.c52.s93"><qs/>'You ungrateful child!'<qe/><sss/> said Mrs Kenwigs, <sse/><qs/>'after I have gone through what I have, this night, for your good.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="38" id="NN.c52.p38" type="speech"><s sid="94" id="NN.c52.s94"><qs/>'I can't help it, ma,'<qe/><sls/> replied Morleena, also in tears; <sle/><qs/>'my hair WILL grow.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="39" id="NN.c52.p39" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="NN.c52.s95"><qs/>'Don't talk to me, you naughty thing!'<qe/><sss/> said Mrs Kenwigs, <sse/><qs/>'don't!</s> <s sid="96" id="NN.c52.s96">Even if I was to trust you by yourself and you were to escape being run over, I know you'd run in to Laura Chopkins,'<qe/><sls/> who was the daughter of the ambitious neighbour, <sle/><qs/>'and tell her what you're going to wear tomorrow, I know you would.</s> <s sid="97" id="NN.c52.s97">You've no proper pride in yourself, and are not to be trusted out of sight for an instant.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="40" id="NN.c52.p40"><s sid="98" id="NN.c52.s98">Deploring the evil-mindedness of her eldest daughter in these terms, Mrs Kenwigs distilled fresh drops of vexation from her eyes, and declared that she did believe there never was anybody so tried as she was.</s> <s sid="99" id="NN.c52.s99">Thereupon, Morleena Kenwigs wept afresh, and they bemoaned themselves together.</s> </p>

<p pid="41" id="NN.c52.p41"><s sid="100" id="NN.c52.s100">Matters were at this point, as Newman Noggs was heard to limp past the door on his way upstairs; when Mrs Kenwigs, gaining new hope from the sound of his footsteps, hastily removed from her countenance as many traces of her late emotion as were effaceable on so short a notice: and presenting herself before him, and representing their dilemma, entreated that he would escort Morleena to the hairdresser's shop.</s> </p>

<p pid="42" id="NN.c52.p42" type="speech"><s sid="101" id="NN.c52.s101"><qs/>'I wouldn't ask you, Mr Noggs,'<qe/><sss/> said Mrs Kenwigs, <sse/><qs/>'if I didn't know what a good, kind-hearted creature you are; no, not for worlds.</s> <s sid="102" id="NN.c52.s102">I am a weak constitution, Mr Noggs, but my spirit would no more let me ask a favour where I thought there was a chance of its being refused, than it would let me submit to see my children trampled down and trod upon, by envy and lowness!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="43" id="NN.c52.p43"><s sid="103" id="NN.c52.s103">Newman was too good-natured not to have consented, even without this avowal of confidence on the part of Mrs Kenwigs.</s> <s sid="104" id="NN.c52.s104">Accordingly, a very few minutes had elapsed, when he and Miss Morleena were on their way to the hairdresser's.</s> </p>

<p pid="44" id="NN.c52.p44"><s sid="105" id="NN.c52.s105">It was not exactly a hairdresser's; that is to say, people of a coarse and vulgar turn of mind might have called it a barber's; for they not only cut and curled ladies elegantly, and children carefully, but shaved gentlemen easily.</s> <s sid="106" id="NN.c52.s106">Still, it was a highly genteel establishment--quite first-rate in fact--and there were displayed in the window, besides other elegancies, waxen busts of a light lady and a dark gentleman which were the admiration of the whole neighbourhood.</s> <s sid="107" id="NN.c52.s107">Indeed, some ladies had gone so far as to assert, that the dark gentleman was actually a portrait of the spirted young proprietor; and the great similarity between their head-dresses--both wore very glossy hair, with a narrow walk straight down the middle, and a profusion of flat circular curls on both sides--encouraged the idea.</s> <s sid="108" id="NN.c52.s108">The better informed among the sex, however, made light of this assertion, for however willing they were (and they were very willing) to do full justice to the handsome face and figure of the proprietor, they held the countenance of the dark gentleman in the window to be an exquisite and abstract idea of masculine beauty, realised sometimes, perhaps, among angels and military men, but very rarely embodied to gladden the eyes of mortals.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="NN.c52.p45"><s sid="109" id="NN.c52.s109">It was to this establishment that Newman Noggs led Miss Kenwigs in safety.</s> <s sid="110" id="NN.c52.s110">The proprietor, knowing that Miss Kenwigs had three sisters, each with two flaxen tails, and all good for sixpence apiece, once a month at least, promptly deserted an old gentleman whom he had just lathered for shaving, and handing him over to the journeyman, (who was not very popular among the ladies, by reason of his obesity and middle age,) waited on the young lady himself.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="NN.c52.p46"><s sid="111" id="NN.c52.s111">Just as this change had been effected, there presented himself for shaving, a big, burly, good-humoured coal-heaver with a pipe in his mouth, who, drawing his hand across his chin, requested to know when a shaver would be disengaged.</s> </p>

<p pid="47" id="NN.c52.p47"><s sid="112" id="NN.c52.s112">The journeyman, to whom this question was put, looked doubtfully at the young proprietor, and the young proprietor looked scornfully at the coal-heaver: observing at the same time:</s> </p>

<p pid="54" id="NN.c52.p54"><s sid="124" id="NN.c52.s124">The old gentleman who had just been lathered, and who was sitting in a melancholy manner with his face turned towards the wall, appeared quite unconscious of this incident, and to be insensible to everything around him in the depth of a reverie--a very mournful one, to judge from the sighs he occasionally vented--in which he was absorbed.</s> <s sid="125" id="NN.c52.s125">Affected by this example, the proprietor began to clip Miss Kenwigs, the journeyman to scrape the old gentleman, and Newman Noggs to read last Sunday's paper, all three in silence: when Miss Kenwigs uttered a shrill little scream, and Newman, raising his eyes, saw that it had been elicited by the circumstance of the old gentleman turning his head, and disclosing the features of Mr Lillyvick the collector.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c53.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c53.s1">With that settled resolution, and steadiness of purpose to which extreme circumstances so often give birth, acting upon far less excitable and more sluggish temperaments than that which was the lot of Madeline Bray's admirer, Nicholas started, at dawn of day, from the restless couch which no sleep had visited on the previous night, and prepared to make that last appeal, by whose slight and fragile thread her only remaining hope of escape depended.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c55.p2" type="speech"><s sid="2" id="NN.c55.s2"><qs/>'Bless my heart, Kate!'<qe/><sls/> so the good lady argued; <sle/><qs/>'if the Mr Cheerybles don't want this young lady to be married, why don't they file a bill against the Lord Chancellor, make her a Chancery ward, and shut her up in the Fleet prison for safety?--I have read of such things in the newspapers a hundred times.</s> <s sid="3" id="NN.c55.s3">Or, if they are so very fond of her as Nicholas says they are, why don't they marry her themselves--one of them I mean?</s> <s sid="4" id="NN.c55.s4">And even supposing they don't want her to be married, and don't want to marry her themselves, why in the name of wonder should Nicholas go about the world, forbidding people's banns?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="3" id="NN.c55.p3" type="speech"><s sid="5" id="NN.c55.s5"><qs/>'I don't think you quite understand,'<qe/> said Kate, gently.</s> </p><p pid="4" id="NN.c55.p4" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="NN.c55.s6"><qs/>'Well I am sure, Kate, my dear, you're very polite!'<qe/> replied Mrs Nickleby.</s> <s sid="7" id="NN.c55.s7"><qs/>'I have been married myself I hope, and I have seen other people married.</s> <s sid="8" id="NN.c55.s8">Not understand, indeed!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="NN.c55.p5" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="NN.c55.s9"><qs/>'I know you have had great experience, dear mama,'<qe/><sss/> said Kate; <sse/><qs/>'I mean that perhaps you don't quite understand all the circumstances in this instance.</s> <s sid="10" id="NN.c55.s10">We have stated them awkwardly, I dare say.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="NN.c55.p6" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="NN.c55.s11"><qs/>'That I dare say you have,'<qe/> retorted her mother, briskly.</s> <s sid="12" id="NN.c55.s12"><qs/>'That's very likely.</s> <s sid="13" id="NN.c55.s13">I am not to be held accountable for that; though, at the same time, as the circumstances speak for themselves, I shall take the liberty, my love, of saying that I do understand them, and perfectly well too; whatever you and Nicholas may choose to think to the contrary.</s> <s sid="14" id="NN.c55.s14">Why is such a great fuss made because this Miss Magdalen is going to marry somebody who is older than herself?</s> <s sid="15" id="NN.c55.s15">Your poor papa was older than I was, four years and a half older.</s> <s sid="16" id="NN.c55.s16">Jane Dibabs--the Dibabses lived in the beautiful little thatched white house one story high, covered all over with ivy and creeping plants, with an exquisite little porch with twining honysuckles and all sorts of things: where the earwigs used to fall into one's tea on a summer evening, and always fell upon their backs and kicked dreadfully, and where the frogs used to get into the rushlight shades when one stopped all night, and sit up and look through the little holes like Christians--Jane Dibabs, SHE married a man who was a great deal older than herself, and WOULD marry him, notwithstanding all that could be said to the contrary, and she was so fond of him that nothing was ever equal to it.</s> <s sid="17" id="NN.c55.s17">There was no fuss made about Jane Dibabs, and her husband was a most honourable and excellent man, and everybody spoke well of him.</s> <s sid="18" id="NN.c55.s18">Then why should there by any fuss about this Magdalen?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="7" id="NN.c55.p7" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="NN.c55.s19"><qs/>'Her husband is much older; he is not her own choice; his character is the very reverse of that which you have just described.</s> <s sid="20" id="NN.c55.s20">Don't you see a broad destinction between the two cases?'<qe/> said Kate.</s> </p><p pid="8" id="NN.c55.p8"><s sid="21" id="NN.c55.s21">To this, Mrs Nickleby only replied that she durst say she was very stupid, indeed she had no doubt she was, for her own children almost as much as told her so, every day of her life; to be sure she was a little older than they, and perhaps some foolish people might think she ought reasonably to know best.</s> <s sid="22" id="NN.c55.s22">However, no doubt she was wrong; of course she was; she always was, she couldn't be right, she couldn't be expected to be; so she had better not expose herself any more; and to all Kate's conciliations and concessions for an hour ensuing, the good lady gave no other replies than Oh, certainly, why did they ask HER?, HER opinion was of no consequence, it didn't matter what SHE said, with many other rejoinders of the same class.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="NN.c55.p9"><s sid="23" id="NN.c55.s23">In this frame of mind (expressed, when she had become too resigned for speech, by nods of the head, upliftings of the eyes, and little beginnings of groans, converted, as they attracted attention, into short coughs), Mrs Nickleby remained until Nicholas and Kate returned with the object of their solicitude; when, having by this time asserted her own importance, and becoming besides interested in the trials of one so young and beautiful, she not only displayed the utmost zeal and solicitude, but took great credit to herself for recommending the course of procedure which her son had adopted: frequently declaring, with an expressive look, that it was very fortunate things were AS they were: and hinting, that but for great encouragement and wisdom on her own part, they never could have been brought to that pass.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="NN.c55.p10"><s sid="24" id="NN.c55.s24">Not to strain the question whether Mrs Nickleby had or had not any great hand in bringing matters about, it is unquestionable that she had strong ground for exultation.</s> <s sid="25" id="NN.c55.s25">The brothers, on their return, bestowed such commendations on Nicholas for the part he had taken, and evinced so much joy at the altered state of events and the recovery of their young friend from trials so great and dangers so threatening, that, as she more than once informed her daughter, she now considered the fortunes of the family 'as good as' made.</s> <s sid="26" id="NN.c55.s26">Mr Charles Cheeryble, indeed, Mrs Nickleby positively asserted, had, in the first transports of his surprise and delight, 'as good as' said so.</s> <s sid="27" id="NN.c55.s27">Without precisely explaining what this qualification meant, she subsided, whenever she mentioned the subject, into such a mysterious and important state, and had such visions of wealth and dignity in perspective, that (vague and clouded though they were) she was, at such times, almost as happy as if she had really been permanently provided for, on a scale of great splendour.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="NN.c55.p11"><s sid="28" id="NN.c55.s28">The sudden and terrible shock she had received, combined with the great affliction and anxiety of mind which she had, for a long time, endured, proved too much for Madeline's strength.</s> <s sid="29" id="NN.c55.s29">Recovering from the state of stupefaction into which the sudden death of her father happily plunged her, she only exchanged that condition for one of dangerous and active illness.</s> <s sid="30" id="NN.c55.s30">When the delicate physical powers which have been sustained by an unnatural strain upon the mental energies and a resolute determination not to yield, at last give way, their degree of prostration is usually proportionate to the strength of the effort which has previously upheld them.</s> <s sid="31" id="NN.c55.s31">Thus it was that the illness which fell on Madeline was of no slight or temporary nature, but one which, for a time, threatened her reason, and--scarcely worse--her life itself.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="NN.c55.p12"><s sid="32" id="NN.c55.s32">Who, slowly recovering from a disorder so severe and dangerous, could be insensible to the unremitting attentions of such a nurse as gentle, tender, earnest Kate?</s> <s sid="33" id="NN.c55.s33">On whom could the sweet soft voice, the light step, the delicate hand, the quiet, cheerful, noiseless discharge of those thousand little offices of kindness and relief which we feel so deeply when we are ill, and forget so lightly when we are well--on whom could they make so deep an impression as on a young heart stored with every pure and true affection that women cherish; almost a stranger to the endearments and devotion of its own sex, save as it learnt them from itself; and rendered, by calamity and suffering, keenly susceptible of the sympathy so long unknown and so long sought in vain?</s> <s sid="34" id="NN.c55.s34">What wonder that days became as years in knitting them together!</s> <s sid="35" id="NN.c55.s35">What wonder, if with every hour of returning health, there came some stronger and sweeter recognition of the praises which Kate, when they recalled old scenes--they seemed old now, and to have been acted years ago--would lavish on her brother!</s> <s sid="36" id="NN.c55.s36">Where would have been the wonder, even, if those praises had found a quick response in the breast of Madeline, and if, with the image of Nicholas so constantly recurring in the features of his sister that she could scarcely separate the two, she had sometimes found it equally difficult to assign to each the feelings they had first inspired, and had imperceptibly mingled with her gratitude to Nicholas, some of that warmer feeling which she had assigned to Kate?</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="NN.c55.p13" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="NN.c55.s37"><qs/>'My dear,'<qe/><sls/> Mrs Nickleby would say, coming into the room with an elaborate caution, calculated to discompose the nerves of an invalid rather more than the entry of a horse-soldier at full gallop; <sle/><qs/>'how do you find yourself tonight?</s> <s sid="38" id="NN.c55.s38">I hope you are better.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="NN.c55.p14" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="NN.c55.s39"><qs/>'Almost well, mama,'<qe/> Kate would reply, laying down her work, and taking Madeline's hand in hers.</s> </p><p pid="15" id="NN.c55.p15" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="NN.c55.s40"><qs/>'Kate!'<qe/></s> <s sid="41" id="NN.c55.s41">Mrs Nickleby would say, reprovingly, 'don't talk so loud' (the worthy lady herself talking in a whisper that would have made the blood of the stoutest man run cold in his veins).</s> </p><p pid="16" id="NN.c55.p16"><s sid="42" id="NN.c55.s42">Kate would take this reproof very quietly, and Mrs Nickleby, making every board creak and every thread rustle as she moved stealthily about, would add:</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="NN.c55.p23"><s sid="62" id="NN.c55.s62">At other times, when Nicholas came home at night, he would be accompanied by Mr Frank Cheeryble, who was commissioned by the brothers to inquire how Madeline was that evening.</s> <s sid="63" id="NN.c55.s63">On such occasions (and they were of very frequent occurrence), Mrs Nickleby deemed it of particular importance that she should have her wits about her; for, from certain signs and tokens which had attracted her attention, she shrewdly suspected that Mr Frank, interested as his uncles were in Madeline, came quite as much to see Kate as to inquire after her; the more especially as the brothers were in constant communication with the medical man, came backwards and forwards very frequently themselves, and received a full report from Nicholas every morning.</s> <s sid="64" id="NN.c55.s64">These were proud times for Mrs Nickleby; never was anybody half so discreet and sage as she, or half so mysterious withal; and never were there such cunning generalship, and such unfathomable designs, as she brought to bear upon Mr Frank, with the view of ascertaining whether her suspicions were well founded: and if so, of tantalising him into taking her into his confidence and throwing himself upon her merciful consideration.</s> <s sid="65" id="NN.c55.s65">Extensive was the artillery, heavy and light, which Mrs Nickleby brought into play for the furtherance of these great schemes; various and opposite the means which she employed to bring about the end she had in view.</s> <s sid="66" id="NN.c55.s66">At one time, she was all cordiality and ease; at another, all stiffness and frigidity.</s> <s sid="67" id="NN.c55.s67">Now, she would seem to open her whole heart to her unhappy victim; the next time they met, she would receive him with the most distant and studious reserve, as if a new light had broken in upon her, and, guessing his intentions, she had resolved to check them in the bud; as if she felt it her bounden duty to act with Spartan firmness, and at once and for ever to discourage hopes which never could be realised.</s> <s sid="68" id="NN.c55.s68">At other times, when Nicholas was not there to overhear, and Kate was upstairs busily tending her sick friend, the worthy lady would throw out dark hints of an intention to send her daughter to France for three or four years, or to Scotland for the improvement of her health impaired by her late fatigues, or to America on a visit, or anywhere that threatened a long and tedious separation.</s> <s sid="69" id="NN.c55.s69">Nay, she even went so far as to hint, obscurely, at an attachment entertained for her daughter by the son of an old neighbour of theirs, one Horatio Peltirogus (a young gentleman who might have been, at that time, four years old, or thereabouts), and to represent it, indeed, as almost a settled thing between the families--only waiting for her daughter's final decision, to come off with the sanction of the church, and to the unspeakable happiness and content of all parties.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="NN.c55.p24"><s sid="70" id="NN.c55.s70">It was in the full pride and glory of having sprung this last mine one night with extraordinary success, that Mrs Nickleby took the opportunity of being left alone with her son before retiring to rest, to sound him on the subject which so occupied her thoughts: not doubting that they could have but one opinion respecting it.</s> <s sid="71" id="NN.c55.s71">To this end, she approached the question with divers laudatory and appropriate remarks touching the general amiability of Mr Frank Cheeryble.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="NN.c55.p25" type="speech"><s sid="72" id="NN.c55.s72"><qs/>'You are quite right, mother,'<qe/><sss/> said Nicholas, <sse/><qs/>'quite right.</s> <s sid="73" id="NN.c55.s73">He is a fine fellow.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="26" id="NN.c55.p26" type="speech"><s sid="74" id="NN.c55.s74"><qs/>'Good-looking, too,'<qe/> said Mrs Nickleby.</s> </p><p pid="27" id="NN.c55.p27" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="NN.c55.s75"><qs/>'Decidedly good-looking,'<qe/> answered Nicholas.</s> </p><p pid="28" id="NN.c55.p28" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="NN.c55.s76"><qs/>'What may you call his nose, now, my dear?'<qe/> pursued Mrs Nickleby, wishing to interest Nicholas in the subject to the utmost.</s> </p><p pid="29" id="NN.c55.p29" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="NN.c55.s77"><qs/>'Call it?'<qe/> repeated Nicholas.</s> </p><p pid="30" id="NN.c55.p30" type="speech"><s sid="78" id="NN.c55.s78"><qs/>'Ah!'<qe/><sss/> returned his mother, <sse/><qs/>'what style of nose?</s> <s sid="79" id="NN.c55.s79">What order of architecture, if one may say so.</s> <s sid="80" id="NN.c55.s80">I am not very learned in noses.</s> <s sid="81" id="NN.c55.s81">Do you call it a Roman or a Grecian?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="31" id="NN.c55.p31" type="speech"><s sid="82" id="NN.c55.s82"><qs/>'Upon my word, mother,'<qe/><sss/> said Nicholas, laughing, <sse/><qs/>'as well as I remember, I should call it a kind of Composite, or mixed nose.</s> <s sid="83" id="NN.c55.s83">But I have no very strong recollection on the subject.</s> <s sid="84" id="NN.c55.s84">If it will afford you any gratification, I'll observe it more closely, and let you know.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="32" id="NN.c55.p32" type="speech"><s sid="85" id="NN.c55.s85"><qs/>'I wish you would, my dear,'<qe/> said Mrs Nickleby, with an earnest look.</s> </p><p pid="33" id="NN.c55.p33" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="NN.c55.s86"><qs/>'Very well,'<qe/> returned Nicholas.</s> <s sid="87" id="NN.c55.s87"><qs/>'I will.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="34" id="NN.c55.p34"><s sid="88" id="NN.c55.s88">Nicholas returned to the perusal of the book he had been reading, when the dialogue had gone thus far.</s> <s sid="89" id="NN.c55.s89">Mrs Nickleby, after stopping a little for consideration, resumed.</s> </p>

<p pid="35" id="NN.c55.p35" type="speech"><s sid="90" id="NN.c55.s90"><qs/>'He is very much attached to you, Nicholas, my dear.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="36" id="NN.c55.p36"><s sid="91" id="NN.c55.s91">Nicholas laughingly said, as he closed his book, that he was glad to hear it, and observed that his mother seemed deep in their new friend's confidence already.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="NN.c55.p37" type="speech"><s sid="92" id="NN.c55.s92"><qs/>'Hem!'<qe/> said Mrs Nickleby.</s> <s sid="93" id="NN.c55.s93"><qs/>'I don't know about that, my dear, but I think it is very necessary that somebody should be in his confidence; highly necessary.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="38" id="NN.c55.p38"><s sid="94" id="NN.c55.s94">Elated by a look of curiosity from her son, and the consciousness of possessing a great secret, all to herself, Mrs Nickleby went on with great animation:</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="NN.c55.p39" type="speech"><s sid="95" id="NN.c55.s95"><qs/>'I am sure, my dear Nicholas, how you can have failed to notice it, is, to me, quite extraordinary; though I don't know why I should say that, either, because, of course, as far as it goes, and to a certain extent, there is a great deal in this sort of thing, especially in this early stage, which, however clear it may be to females, can scarcely be expected to be so evident to men.</s> <s sid="96" id="NN.c55.s96">I don't say that I have any particular penetration in such matters.</s> <s sid="97" id="NN.c55.s97">I may have; those about me should know best about that, and perhaps do know.</s> <s sid="98" id="NN.c55.s98">Upon that point I shall express no opinion, it wouldn't become me to do so, it's quite out of the question, quite.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="40" id="NN.c55.p40"><s sid="99" id="NN.c55.s99">Nicholas snuffed the candles, put his hands in his pockets, and, leaning back in his chair, assumed a look of patient suffering and melancholy resignation.</s> </p>

<p pid="111" id="NN.c56.p111"><s sid="258" id="NN.c56.s258">These were, the age, decrepitude, and weakness of Mrs Sliderskew; the great improbability of her having any accomplice or even acquaintance: taking into account her secluded habits, and her long residence in such a house as Gride's; the strong reason there was to suppose that the robbery was not the result of a concerted plan: otherwise she would have watched an opportunity of carrying off a sum of money; the difficulty she would be placed in when she began to think on what she had done, and found herself encumbered with documents of whose nature she was utterly ignorant; and the comparative ease with which somebody, with a full knowledge of her position, obtaining access to her, and working on her fears, if necessary, might worm himself into her confidence and obtain, under one pretence or another, free possession of the deed.</s> <s sid="259" id="NN.c56.s259">To these were added such considerations as the constant residence of Mr Squeers at a long distance from London, which rendered his association with Mrs Sliderskew a mere masquerading frolic, in which nobody was likely to recognise him, either at the time or afterwards; the impossibility of Ralph's undertaking the task himself, he being already known to her by sight; and various comments on the uncommon tact and experience of Mr Squeers: which would make his overreaching one old woman a mere matter of child's play and amusement.</s> <s sid="260" id="NN.c56.s260">In addition to these influences and persuasions, Ralph drew, with his utmost skill and power, a vivid picture of the defeat which Nicholas would sustain, should they succeed, in linking himself to a beggar, where he expected to wed an heiress--glanced at the immeasurable importance it must be to a man situated as Squeers, to preserve such a friend as himself--dwelt on a long train of benefits, conferred since their first acquaintance, when he had reported favourably of his treatment of a sickly boy who had died under his hands (and whose death was very convenient to Ralph and his clients, but this he did NOT say), and finally hinted that the fifty pounds might be increased to seventy-five, or, in the event of very great success, even to a hundred.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 57 How Ralph Nickleby's Auxiliary went about his Work, and how he prospered with it</title>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c57.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c57.s1">It was a dark, wet, gloomy night in autumn, when in an upper room of a mean house situated in an obscure street, or rather court, near Lambeth, there sat, all alone, a one-eyed man grotesquely habited, either for lack of better garments or for purposes of disguise, in a loose greatcoat, with arms half as long again as his own, and a capacity of breadth and length which would have admitted of his winding himself in it, head and all, with the utmost ease, and without any risk of straining the old and greasy material of which it was composed.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c57.p2"><s sid="2" id="NN.c57.s2">So attired, and in a place so far removed from his usual haunts and occupations, and so very poor and wretched in its character, perhaps Mrs Squeers herself would have had some difficulty in recognising her lord: quickened though her natural sagacity doubtless would have been by the affectionate yearnings and impulses of a tender wife.</s> <s sid="3" id="NN.c57.s3">But Mrs Squeers's lord it was; and in a tolerably disconsolate mood Mrs Squeers's lord appeared to be, as, helping himself from a black bottle which stood on the table beside him, he cast round the chamber a look, in which very slight regard for the objects within view was plainly mingled with some regretful and impatient recollection of distant scenes and persons.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER 65 Conclusion</title>

<p pid="1" id="NN.c65.p1"><s sid="1" id="NN.c65.s1">When her term of mourning had expired, Madeline gave her hand and fortune to Nicholas; and, on the same day and at the same time, Kate became Mrs Frank Cheeryble.</s> <s sid="2" id="NN.c65.s2">It was expected that Tim Linkinwater and Miss La Creevy would have made a third couple on the occasion, but they declined, and two or three weeks afterwards went out together one morning before breakfast, and, coming back with merry faces, were found to have been quietly married that day.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="NN.c65.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="NN.c65.s3">The money which Nicholas acquired in right of his wife he invested in the firm of Cheeryble Brothers, in which Frank had become a partner.</s> <s sid="4" id="NN.c65.s4">Before many years elapsed, the business began to be carried on in the names of <qs/>'Cheeryble and Nickleby,'<qe/> so that Mrs Nickleby's prophetic anticipations were realised at last.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="NN.c65.p3"><s sid="5" id="NN.c65.s5">The twin brothers retired.</s> <s sid="6" id="NN.c65.s6">Who needs to be told that THEY were happy?</s> <s sid="7" id="NN.c65.s7">They were surrounded by happiness of their own creation, and lived but to increase it.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="NN.c65.p4"><s sid="8" id="NN.c65.s8">Tim Linkinwater condescended, after much entreaty and brow-beating, to accept a share in the house; but he could never be prevailed upon to suffer the publication of his name as a partner, and always persisted in the punctual and regular discharge of his clerkly duties.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="NN.c65.p5"><s sid="9" id="NN.c65.s9">He and his wife lived in the old house, and occupied the very bedchamber in which he had slept for four-and-forty years.</s> <s sid="10" id="NN.c65.s10">As his wife grew older, she became even a more cheerful and light-hearted little creature; and it was a common saying among their friends, that it was impossible to say which looked the happier, Tim as he sat calmly smiling in his elbow-chair on one side of the fire, or his brisk little wife chatting and laughing, and constantly bustling in and out of hers, on the other.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="NN.c65.p6"><s sid="11" id="NN.c65.s11">Dick, the blackbird, was removed from the counting-house and promoted to a warm corner in the common sitting-room.</s> <s sid="12" id="NN.c65.s12">Beneath his cage hung two miniatures, of Mrs Linkinwater's execution; one representing herself, and the other Tim; and both smiling very hard at all beholders.</s> <s sid="13" id="NN.c65.s13">Tim's head being powdered like a twelfth cake, and his spectacles copied with great nicety, strangers detected a close resemblance to him at the first glance, and this leading them to suspect that the other must be his wife, and emboldening them to say so without scruple, Mrs Linkinwater grew very proud of these achievements in time, and considered them among the most successful likenesses she had ever painted.</s> <s sid="14" id="NN.c65.s14">Tim had the profoundest faith in them, likewise; for on this, as on all other subjects, they held but one opinion; and if ever there were a 'comfortable couple' in the world, it was Mr and Mrs Linkinwater.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="NN.c65.p7"><s sid="15" id="NN.c65.s15">Ralph, having died intestate, and having no relations but those with whom he had lived in such enmity, they would have become in legal course his heirs.</s> <s sid="16" id="NN.c65.s16">But they could not bear the thought of growing rich on money so acquired, and felt as though they could never hope to prosper with it.</s> <s sid="17" id="NN.c65.s17">They made no claim to his wealth; and the riches for which he had toiled all his days, and burdened his soul with so many evil deeds, were swept at last into the coffers of the state, and no man was the better or the happier for them.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="NN.c65.p8"><s sid="18" id="NN.c65.s18">Arthur Gride was tried for the unlawful possession of the will, which he had either procured to be stolen, or had dishonestly acquired and retained by other means as bad.</s> <s sid="19" id="NN.c65.s19">By dint of an ingenious counsel, and a legal flaw, he escaped; but only to undergo a worse punishment; for, some years afterwards, his house was broken open in the night by robbers, tempted by the rumours of his great wealth, and he was found murdered in his bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="NN.c65.p9"><s sid="20" id="NN.c65.s20">Mrs Sliderskew went beyond the seas at nearly the same time as Mr Squeers, and in the course of nature never returned.</s> <s sid="21" id="NN.c65.s21">Brooker died penitent.</s> <s sid="22" id="NN.c65.s22">Sir Mulberry Hawk lived abroad for some years, courted and caressed, and in high repute as a fine dashing fellow.</s> <s sid="23" id="NN.c65.s23">Ultimately, returning to this country, he was thrown into jail for debt, and there perished miserably, as such high spirits generally do.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="NN.c65.p10"><s sid="24" id="NN.c65.s24">The first act of Nicholas, when he became a rich and prosperous merchant, was to buy his father's old house.</s> <s sid="25" id="NN.c65.s25">As time crept on, and there came gradually about him a group of lovely children, it was altered and enlarged; but none of the old rooms were ever pulled down, no old tree was ever rooted up, nothing with which there was any association of bygone times was ever removed or changed.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="NN.c65.p11"><s sid="26" id="NN.c65.s26">Within a stone's throw was another retreat, enlivened by children's pleasant voices too; and here was Kate, with many new cares and occupations, and many new faces courting her sweet smile (and one so like her own, that to her mother she seemed a child again), the same true gentle creature, the same fond sister, the same in the love of all about her, as in her girlish days.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="NN.c65.p12"><s sid="27" id="NN.c65.s27">Mrs Nickleby lived, sometimes with her daughter, and sometimes with her son, accompanying one or other of them to London at those periods when the cares of business obliged both families to reside there, and always preserving a great appearance of dignity, and relating her experiences (especially on points connected with the management and bringing-up of children) with much solemnity and importance.</s> <s sid="28" id="NN.c65.s28">It was a very long time before she could be induced to receive Mrs Linkinwater into favour, and it is even doubtful whether she ever thoroughly forgave her.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="NN.c65.p13"><s sid="29" id="NN.c65.s29">There was one grey-haired, quiet, harmless gentleman, who, winter and summer, lived in a little cottage hard by Nicholas's house, and, when he was not there, assumed the superintendence of affairs.</s> <s sid="30" id="NN.c65.s30">His chief pleasure and delight was in the children, with whom he was a child himself, and master of the revels.</s> <s sid="31" id="NN.c65.s31">The little people could do nothing without dear Newman Noggs.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="NN.c65.p14"><s sid="32" id="NN.c65.s32">The grass was green above the dead boy's grave, and trodden by feet so small and light, that not a daisy drooped its head beneath their pressure.</s> <s sid="33" id="NN.c65.s33">Through all the spring and summertime, garlands of fresh flowers, wreathed by infant hands, rested on the stone; and, when the children came to change them lest they should wither and be pleasant to him no longer, their eyes filled with tears, and they spoke low and softly of their poor dead cousin.</s> </p></div>
