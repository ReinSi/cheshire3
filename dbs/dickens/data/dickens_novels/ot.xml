<title>CHAPTER I TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH</title>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c1.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c1.s1">Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c1.p2"><s sid="2" id="OT.c1.s2">For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OT.c1.p3"><s sid="3" id="OT.c1.s3">Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred.</s> <s sid="4" id="OT.c1.s4">The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,--a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.</s> <s sid="5" id="OT.c1.s5">Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time.</s> <s sid="6" id="OT.c1.s6">There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them.</s> <s sid="7" id="OT.c1.s7">The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed  upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OT.c1.p4" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="OT.c1.s8">As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, <qs/>'Let me see the child, and die.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="OT.c1.p5"><s sid="9" id="OT.c1.s9">The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately.</s> <s sid="10" id="OT.c1.s10">As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed's head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him:</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="OT.c1.p6" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="OT.c1.s11"><qs/>'Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="7" id="OT.c1.p7" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="OT.c1.s12"><qs/>'Lor bless her dear heart, no!'<qe/> interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.</s> </p><p pid="8" id="OT.c1.p8" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="OT.c1.s13"><qs/>'Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all on 'em dead except two, and them in the wurkus with me, she'll know better than to take on in that way, bless her dear heart!</s> <s sid="14" id="OT.c1.s14">Think what it is to be a mother, there's a dear young lamb do.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="9" id="OT.c1.p9"><s sid="15" id="OT.c1.s15">Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother's prospects failed in producing its due effect.</s> <s sid="16" id="OT.c1.s16">The patient shook her head, and stretched out her hand towards the child.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="OT.c1.p10"><s sid="17" id="OT.c1.s17">The surgeon deposited it in her arms.</s> <s sid="18" id="OT.c1.s18">She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back--and died.</s> <s sid="19" id="OT.c1.s19">They chafed her breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever.</s> <s sid="20" id="OT.c1.s20">They talked of hope and comfort.</s> <s sid="21" id="OT.c1.s21">They had been strangers too long.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="OT.c1.p11" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="OT.c1.s22"><qs/>'It's all over, Mrs. Thingummy!'<qe/> said the surgeon at last.</s> </p><p pid="12" id="OT.c1.p12" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="OT.c1.s23"><qs/>'Ah, poor dear, so it is!'<qe/> said the nurse, picking up the cork of the green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to take up the child.</s> <s sid="24" id="OT.c1.s24"><qs/>'Poor dear!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="OT.c1.p13" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="OT.c1.s25"><qs/>'You needn't mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,'<qe/> said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation.</s> <s sid="26" id="OT.c1.s26"><qs/>'It's very likely it _will_ be troublesome.</s> <s sid="27" id="OT.c1.s27">Give it a little gruel if it is.'<qe/></s> <s sid="28" id="OT.c1.s28">He put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door, added, <qs/>'She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="14" id="OT.c1.p14" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="OT.c1.s29"><qs/>'She was brought here last night,'<qe/><sss/> replied the old woman, <sse/><qs/>'by the overseer's order.</s> <s sid="30" id="OT.c1.s30">She was found lying in the street.</s> <s sid="31" id="OT.c1.s31">She had walked some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="OT.c1.p15" type="speech"><s sid="32" id="OT.c1.s32">The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand.</s> <s sid="33" id="OT.c1.s33"><qs/>'The old story,'<qe/> he said, shaking his head:</s> <s sid="34" id="OT.c1.s34"><qs/>'no wedding-ring, I see.</s> <s sid="35" id="OT.c1.s35">Ah!</s> <s sid="36" id="OT.c1.s36">Good-night!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="16" id="OT.c1.p16"><s sid="37" id="OT.c1.s37">The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="OT.c1.p17"><s sid="38" id="OT.c1.s38">What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was!</s> <s sid="39" id="OT.c1.s39">Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society.</s> <s sid="40" id="OT.c1.s40">But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once--a parish child--the orphan of a workhouse--the humble, half-starved drudge--to be cuffed and buffeted through the world--despised by all, and pitied by none.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="OT.c1.p18"><s sid="41" id="OT.c1.s41">Oliver cried lustily.</s> <s sid="42" id="OT.c1.s42">If he could have known that he was an orphan, left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he would have cried the louder.</s> </p></div>

<title>CHAPTER II TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST'S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD</title>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c2.p1" type="speech"><s sid="1" id="OT.c2.s1">For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception.</s> <s sid="2" id="OT.c2.s2">He was brought up by hand.</s> <s sid="3" id="OT.c2.s3">The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities.</s> <s sid="4" id="OT.c2.s4">The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in 'the house' who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need.</s> <s sid="5" id="OT.c2.s5">The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not.</s> <s sid="6" id="OT.c2.s6">Upon this, the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be <qs/>'farmed,'<qe/> or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.</s> <s sid="7" id="OT.c2.s7">Sevenpence-halfpenny's worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable.</s> <s sid="8" id="OT.c2.s8">The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself.</s> <s sid="9" id="OT.c2.s9">So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them.</s> <s sid="10" id="OT.c2.s10">Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher.</s> </p><p pid="2" id="OT.c2.p2"><s sid="11" id="OT.c2.s11">Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air.</s> <s sid="12" id="OT.c2.s12">Unfortunately for, the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OT.c2.p3"><s sid="13" id="OT.c2.s13">Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead, or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing--though the latter accident was very scarce, anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm--the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance.</s> <s sid="14" id="OT.c2.s14">But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional.</s> <s sid="15" id="OT.c2.s15">Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were going.</s> <s sid="16" id="OT.c2.s16">The children were neat and clean to behold, when _they_ went; and what more would the people have!</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OT.c2.p4"><s sid="17" id="OT.c2.s17">It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop.</s> <s sid="18" id="OT.c2.s18">Oliver Twist's ninth birthday found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and decidedly small in circumference.</s> <s sid="19" id="OT.c2.s19">But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver's breast.</s> <s sid="20" id="OT.c2.s20">It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth-day at all.</s> <s sid="21" id="OT.c2.s21">Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="OT.c2.p5" type="speech"><s sid="22" id="OT.c2.s22"><qs/>'Goodness gracious!</s> <s sid="23" id="OT.c2.s23">Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?'<qe/> said Mrs. Mann, thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy.</s> <s sid="24" id="OT.c2.s24"><qs/>'(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash 'em directly.)--My heart alive!</s> <s sid="25" id="OT.c2.s25">Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you, sure-ly!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="OT.c2.p6"><s sid="26" id="OT.c2.s26">Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle's.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="OT.c2.p7" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="OT.c2.s27"><qs/>'Lor, only think,'<qe/><sls/> said Mrs. Mann, running out,--for the three boys had been removed by this time,--<sle/><qs/>'only think of that!</s> <s sid="28" id="OT.c2.s28">That I should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them dear children!</s> <s sid="29" id="OT.c2.s29">Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="8" id="OT.c2.p8"><s sid="30" id="OT.c2.s30">Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the beadle.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="OT.c2.p9" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="OT.c2.s31"><qs/>'Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,'<qe/><sls/> inquired Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane, <sle/><qs/>'to keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans?</s> <s sid="32" id="OT.c2.s32">Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="10" id="OT.c2.p10" type="speech"><s sid="33" id="OT.c2.s33"><qs/>'I'm sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,'<qe/> replied Mrs. Mann with great humility.</s> </p><p pid="11" id="OT.c2.p11"><s sid="34" id="OT.c2.s34">Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance.</s> <s sid="35" id="OT.c2.s35">He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other.</s> <s sid="36" id="OT.c2.s36">He relaxed.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="OT.c2.p12" type="speech"><s sid="37" id="OT.c2.s37"><qs/>'Well, well, Mrs. Mann,'<qe/><sls/> he replied in a calmer tone; <sle/><qs/>'it may be as you say; it may be.</s> <s sid="38" id="OT.c2.s38">Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and have something to say.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="13" id="OT.c2.p13"><s sid="39" id="OT.c2.s39">Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor; placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane on the table before him.</s> <s sid="40" id="OT.c2.s40">Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the cocked hat, and smiled.</s> <s sid="41" id="OT.c2.s41">Yes, he smiled.</s> <s sid="42" id="OT.c2.s42">Beadles are but men: and Mr. Bumble smiled.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER III RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECURE</title>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c3.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c3.s1">For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board.</s> <s sid="2" id="OT.c3.s2">It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have established that sage individual's prophetic character, once and for ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the wall, and attaching himself to the other.</s> <s sid="3" id="OT.c3.s3">To the performance of this feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals.</s> <s sid="4" id="OT.c3.s4">There was a still greater obstacle in Oliver's youth and childishness.</s> <s sid="5" id="OT.c3.s5">He only cried bitterly all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c3.p2" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="OT.c3.s6">Let it not be supposed by the enemies of <qs/>'the system,'<qe/> that, during the period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious consolation.</s> <s sid="7" id="OT.c3.s7">As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated applications of the cane.</s> <s sid="8" id="OT.c3.s8">As for society, he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example.</s> <s sid="9" id="OT.c3.s9">And so for from being denied the advantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console his mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="OT.c3.p3"><s sid="10" id="OT.c3.s10">It chanced one morning, while Oliver's affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way down the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become rather pressing.</s> <s sid="11" id="OT.c3.s11">Mr. Gamfield's most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount; and, in a species of arthimetical desperation, he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his eyes encountered the bill on the gate.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OT.c3.p4" type="speech"><s sid="12" id="OT.c3.s12"><qs/>'Wo--o!'<qe/> said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.</s> </p><p pid="5" id="OT.c3.p5"><s sid="13" id="OT.c3.s13">The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably, whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c5.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c5.s1">Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker's shop, set the lamp down on a workman's bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand.</s> <s sid="2" id="OT.c5.s2">An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a cold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object: from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him mad with terror.</s> <s sid="3" id="OT.c5.s3">Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets.</s> <s sid="4" id="OT.c5.s4">Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by four black steeds, approaching in the distance.</s> <s sid="5" id="OT.c5.s5">The shop was close and hot.</s> <s sid="6" id="OT.c5.s6">The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins.</s> <s sid="7" id="OT.c5.s7">The recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust, looked like a grave.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c5.p2"><s sid="8" id="OT.c5.s8">Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver.</s> <s sid="9" id="OT.c5.s9">He was alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation.</s> <s sid="10" id="OT.c5.s10">The boy had no friends to care for, or to care for him.</s> <s sid="11" id="OT.c5.s11">The regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and well-remembered face sank heavily into his heart.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OT.c5.p3"><s sid="12" id="OT.c5.s12">But his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the tall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OT.c5.p4"><s sid="13" id="OT.c5.s13">Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of the shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times.</s> <s sid="14" id="OT.c5.s14">When he began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="OT.c5.p5" type="speech"><s sid="15" id="OT.c5.s15"><qs/>'Open the door, will yer?'<qe/> cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door.</s> </p><p pid="6" id="OT.c5.p6" type="speech"><s sid="16" id="OT.c5.s16"><qs/>'I will, directly, sir,'<qe/> replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning the key.</s> </p><p pid="7" id="OT.c5.p7" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="OT.c5.s17"><qs/>'I suppose yer the new boy, ain't yer?'<qe/> said the voice through the key-hole.</s> </p><p pid="8" id="OT.c5.p8" type="speech"><s sid="18" id="OT.c5.s18"><qs/>'Yes, sir,'<qe/> replied Oliver.</s> </p><p pid="9" id="OT.c5.p9" type="speech"><s sid="19" id="OT.c5.s19"><qs/>'How old are yer?'<qe/> inquired the voice.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="OT.c5.p10" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="OT.c5.s20"><qs/>'Ten, sir,'<qe/> replied Oliver.</s> </p><p pid="11" id="OT.c5.p11" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="OT.c5.s21"><qs/>'Then I'll whop yer when I get in,'<qe/> said the voice; 'you just see if I don't, that's all, my work'us brat!' and having made this obliging promise, the voice began to whistle.</s> </p><p pid="12" id="OT.c5.p12"><s sid="22" id="OT.c5.s22">Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would redeem his pledge, most honourably.</s> <s sid="23" id="OT.c5.s23">He drew back the bolts with a trembling hand, and opened the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="OT.c5.p13"><s sid="24" id="OT.c5.s24">For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street, and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had addressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm himself; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut into wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then consumed with great dexterity.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="OT.c5.p14" type="speech"><s sid="25" id="OT.c5.s25"><qs/>'I beg your pardon, sir,'<qe/><sls/> said Oliver at length: seeing that no other visitor made his appearance; <sle/><qs/>'did you knock?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="OT.c5.p15" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="OT.c5.s26"><qs/>'I kicked,'<qe/> replied the charity-boy.</s> </p><p pid="16" id="OT.c5.p16" type="speech"><s sid="27" id="OT.c5.s27"><qs/>'Did you want a coffin, sir?'<qe/> inquired Oliver, innocently.</s> </p><p pid="17" id="OT.c5.p17"><s sid="28" id="OT.c5.s28">At this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver would want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way.</s> </p>

<p pid="18" id="OT.c5.p18"><s sid="29" id="OT.c5.s29">'Yer don't know who I am, I suppose, Work'us?' said the charity-boy, in continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with edifying gravity.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="OT.c5.p19" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="OT.c5.s30"><qs/>'No, sir,'<qe/> rejoined Oliver.</s> </p><p pid="20" id="OT.c5.p20" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="OT.c5.s31"><qs/>'I'm Mister Noah Claypole,'<qe/><sss/> said the charity-boy, <sse/><qs/>'and you're under me.</s> <s sid="32" id="OT.c5.s32">Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!'<qe/></s> <s sid="33" id="OT.c5.s33">With this, Mr. Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a dignified air, which did him great credit.</s> <s sid="34" id="OT.c5.s34">It is difficult for a large-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls.</s> </p><p pid="21" id="OT.c5.p21" type="speech"><s sid="35" id="OT.c5.s35">Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the assurance that <qs/>'he'd catch it,'<qe/> condescended to help him.</s> <s sid="36" id="OT.c5.s36">Mr. Sowerberry came down soon after.</s> <s sid="37" id="OT.c5.s37">Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry appeared.</s> <s sid="38" id="OT.c5.s38">Oliver having <qs/>'caught it,'<qe/> in fulfilment of Noah's prediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.</s> </p><p pid="22" id="OT.c5.p22" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="OT.c5.s39"><qs/>'Come near the fire, Noah,'<qe/> said Charlotte.</s> <s sid="40" id="OT.c5.s40"><qs/>'I saved a nice little bit of bacon for you from master's breakfast.</s> <s sid="41" id="OT.c5.s41">Oliver, shut that door at Mister Noah's back, and take them bits that I've put out on the cover of the bread-pan.</s> <s sid="42" id="OT.c5.s42">There's your tea; take it away to that box, and drink it there, and make haste, for they'll want you to mind the shop.</s> <s sid="43" id="OT.c5.s43">D'ye hear?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="23" id="OT.c5.p23"><s sid="44" id="OT.c5.s44">'D'ye hear, Work'us?' said Noah Claypole.</s> </p>

<p pid="24" id="OT.c5.p24" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="OT.c5.s45"><qs/>'Lor, Noah!'<qe/><sss/> said Charlotte, <sse/><qs/>'what a rum creature you are!</s> <s sid="46" id="OT.c5.s46">Why don't you let the boy alone?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="OT.c5.p25" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="OT.c5.s47"><qs/>'Let him alone!'<qe/> said Noah.</s> <s sid="48" id="OT.c5.s48"><qs/>'Why everybody lets him alone enough, for the matter of that.</s> <s sid="49" id="OT.c5.s49">Neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him.</s> <s sid="50" id="OT.c5.s50">All his relations let him have his own way pretty well.</s> <s sid="51" id="OT.c5.s51">Eh, Charlotte?</s> <s sid="52" id="OT.c5.s52">He! he! he!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="26" id="OT.c5.p26" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="OT.c5.s53"><qs/>'Oh, you queer soul!'<qe/> said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him.</s> </p><p pid="27" id="OT.c5.p27" type="speech"><s sid="54" id="OT.c5.s54">Noah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan.</s> <s sid="55" id="OT.c5.s55">No chance-child was he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents, who lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction.</s> <s sid="56" id="OT.c5.s56">The shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of <qs/>'leathers,'<qe/> 'charity,' and the like; and Noah had bourne them without reply.</s> <s sid="57" id="OT.c5.s57">But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted on him with interest.</s> <s sid="58" id="OT.c5.s58">This affords charming food for contemplation.</s> <s sid="59" id="OT.c5.s59">It shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity-boy.</s> </p><p pid="28" id="OT.c5.p28"><s sid="60" id="OT.c5.s60">Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker's some three weeks or a month.</s> <s sid="61" id="OT.c5.s61">Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry--the shop being shut up--were taking their supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after several deferential glances at his wife, said,</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c6.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c6.s1">The month's trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed.</s> <s sid="2" id="OT.c6.s2">It was a nice sickly season just at this time.</s> <s sid="3" id="OT.c6.s3">In commercial phrase, coffins were looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great deal of experience.</s> <s sid="4" id="OT.c6.s4">The success of Mr. Sowerberry's ingenious speculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes.</s> <s sid="5" id="OT.c6.s5">The oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to his knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town.</s> <s sid="6" id="OT.c6.s6">As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded people bear their trials and losses.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c6.p2"><s sid="7" id="OT.c6.s7">For instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need be--quite cheerful and contented--conversing together with as much freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them.</s> <s sid="8" id="OT.c6.s8">Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness.</s> <s sid="9" id="OT.c6.s9">Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible.</s> <s sid="10" id="OT.c6.s10">It was observable, too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over.</s> <s sid="11" id="OT.c6.s11">All this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OT.c6.p3"><s sid="12" id="OT.c6.s12">That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in the muffin-cap and leathers.</s> <s sid="13" id="OT.c6.s13">Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry was disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in the grain department of a brewery.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="OT.c6.p5"><s sid="15" id="OT.c6.s15">One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton--a pound and a half of the worst end of the neck--when Charlotte being called out of the way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="OT.c6.p6"><s sid="16" id="OT.c6.s16">Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the table-cloth; and pulled Oliver's hair; and twitched his ears; and expressed his opinion that he was a 'sneak'; and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was.</s> <s sid="17" id="OT.c6.s17">But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and in his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want to be funny.</s> <s sid="18" id="OT.c6.s18">He got rather personal.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c8.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c8.s1">Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more gained the high-road.</s> <s sid="2" id="OT.c8.s2">It was eight o'clock now.</s> <s sid="3" id="OT.c8.s3">Though he was nearly five miles away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by turns, till noon: fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken.</s> <s sid="4" id="OT.c8.s4">Then he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think, for the first time, where he had better go and try to live.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c8.p2"><s sid="5" id="OT.c8.s5">The stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London.</s> <s sid="6" id="OT.c8.s6">The name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy's mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OT.c8.p3"><s sid="7" id="OT.c8.s7">London!--that great place!--nobody--not even Mr. Bumble--could ever find him there!</s> <s sid="8" id="OT.c8.s8">He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too, say that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways of living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of.</s> <s sid="9" id="OT.c8.s9">It was the very place for a homeless boy, who must die in the streets unless some one helped him.</s> <s sid="10" id="OT.c8.s10">As these things passed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again walked forward.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OT.c8.p4" type="speech"><s sid="11" id="OT.c8.s11">He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination.</s> <s sid="12" id="OT.c8.s12">As this consideration forced itself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his means of getting there.</s> <s sid="13" id="OT.c8.s13">He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two pairs of stockings, in his bundle.</s> <s sid="14" id="OT.c8.s14">He had a penny too--a gift of Sowerberry's after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well--in his pocket.</s> <s sid="15" id="OT.c8.s15"><qs/>'A clean shirt,'<qe/><sss/> thought Oliver, <sse/><qs/>'is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings; and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles' walk in winter time.'<qe/></s> <s sid="16" id="OT.c8.s16">But Oliver's thoughts, like those of most other people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and trudged on.</s> </p><p pid="5" id="OT.c8.p5"><s sid="17" id="OT.c8.s17">Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side.</s> <s sid="18" id="OT.c8.s18">When the night came, he turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined to lie there, till morning.</s> <s sid="19" id="OT.c8.s19">He felt frightened at first, for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields: and he was cold and hungry, and more alone than he had ever felt before.</s> <s sid="20" id="OT.c8.s20">Being very tired with his walk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="OT.c8.p6"><s sid="21" id="OT.c8.s21">He felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very first village through which he passed.</s> <s sid="22" id="OT.c8.s22">He had walked no more than twelve miles, when night closed in again.</s> <s sid="23" id="OT.c8.s23">His feet were sore, and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him.</s> <s sid="24" id="OT.c8.s24">Another night passed in the bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="OT.c8.p7"><s sid="25" id="OT.c8.s25">He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took any notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny.</s> <s sid="26" id="OT.c8.s26">Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet.</s> <s sid="27" id="OT.c8.s27">When the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn't deserve anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="OT.c8.p8"><s sid="28" id="OT.c8.s28">In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to jail.</s> <s sid="29" id="OT.c8.s29">This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition.</s> <s sid="30" id="OT.c8.s30">In others, he would stand about the inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed: a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady's ordering one of the post-boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of the place, for she was sure he had come to steal something.</s> <s sid="31" id="OT.c8.s31">If he begged at a farmer's house, ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about the beadle--which brought Oliver's heart into his mouth,--very often the only thing he had there, for many hours together.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="OT.c8.p9"><s sid="32" id="OT.c8.s32">In fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a benevolent old lady, Oliver's troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his mother's; in other words, he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king's highway.</s> <s sid="33" id="OT.c8.s33">But the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady, who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little she could afford--and more--with such kind and gentle words, and such tears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver's soul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="OT.c8.p10"><s sid="34" id="OT.c8.s34">Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver limped slowly into the little town of Barnet.</s> <s sid="35" id="OT.c8.s35">The window-shutters were closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business of the day.</s> <s sid="36" id="OT.c8.s36">The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation, as he sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="OT.c8.p11"><s sid="37" id="OT.c8.s37">By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up; and people began passing to and fro.</s> <s sid="38" id="OT.c8.s38">Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there.</s> <s sid="39" id="OT.c8.s39">He had no heart to beg.</s> <s sid="40" id="OT.c8.s40">And there he sat.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="OT.c8.p12"><s sid="41" id="OT.c8.s41">He had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great number of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern, large or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by observing that a boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes before, had returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way.</s> <s sid="42" id="OT.c8.s42">He took little heed of this at first; but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long, that Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look.</s> <s sid="43" id="OT.c8.s43">Upon this, the boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said,</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER X OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW ASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT, BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY</title>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c10.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c10.s1">For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew's room, picking the marks out of the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning.</s> <s sid="2" id="OT.c10.s2">At length, he began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c10.p2"><s sid="3" id="OT.c10.s3">Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman's character.</s> <s sid="4" id="OT.c10.s4">Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed, he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by sending them supperless to bed.</s> <s sid="5" id="OT.c10.s5">On one occasion, indeed, he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OT.c10.p3"><s sid="6" id="OT.c10.s6">At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought.</s> <s sid="7" id="OT.c10.s7">There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two or three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre.</s> <s sid="8" id="OT.c10.s8">Perhaps these were reasons for the old gentleman's giving his assent; but, whether they were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OT.c10.p4"><s sid="9" id="OT.c10.s9">The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up, and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they were going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in, first.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="OT.c10.p5"><s sid="10" id="OT.c10.s10">The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter, that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman, by not going to work at all.</s> <s sid="11" id="OT.c10.s11">The Dodger had a vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction.</s> <s sid="12" id="OT.c10.s12">These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="OT.c10.p6"><s sid="13" id="OT.c10.s13">They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion of terms, 'The Green': when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying his finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the greatest caution and circumspection.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="OT.c10.p13"><s sid="23" id="OT.c10.s23">The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a powdered head and gold spectacles.</s> <s sid="24" id="OT.c10.s24">He was dressed in a bottle-green coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a smart bamboo cane under his arm.</s> <s sid="25" id="OT.c10.s25">He had taken up a book from the stall, and there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his elbow-chair, in his own study.</s> <s sid="26" id="OT.c10.s26">It is very possible that he fancied himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he saw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short, anything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through: turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at the top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest interest and eagerness.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="OT.c10.p14"><s sid="27" id="OT.c10.s27">What was Oliver's horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman's pocket, and draw from thence a handkerchief!</s> <s sid="28" id="OT.c10.s28">To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and finally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full speed!</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="OT.c10.p15"><s sid="29" id="OT.c10.s29">In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches, and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy's mind.</s> </p>

<p pid="16" id="OT.c10.p16"><s sid="30" id="OT.c10.s30">He stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then, confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he did, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="OT.c10.p17" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="OT.c10.s31">This was all done in a minute's space.</s> <s sid="32" id="OT.c10.s32">In the very instant when Oliver began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round.</s> <s sid="33" id="OT.c10.s33">Seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator; and shouting <qs/>'Stop thief!'<qe/> with all his might, made off after him, book in hand.</s> </p><p pid="18" id="OT.c10.p18" type="speech"><s sid="34" id="OT.c10.s34">But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue-and-cry.</s> <s sid="35" id="OT.c10.s35">The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner.</s> <s sid="36" id="OT.c10.s36">They no sooner heard the cry, and saw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting <qs/>'Stop thief!'<qe/> too, joined in the pursuit like good citizens.</s> </p><p pid="19" id="OT.c10.p19"><s sid="37" id="OT.c10.s37">Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation is the first law of nature.</s> <s sid="38" id="OT.c10.s38">If he had been, perhaps he would have been prepared for this.</s> <s sid="39" id="OT.c10.s39">Not being prepared, however, it alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c12.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c12.s1">The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which Oliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady street near Pentonville.</s> <s sid="2" id="OT.c12.s2">Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c12.p2"><s sid="3" id="OT.c12.s3">But, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends.</s> <s sid="4" id="OT.c12.s4">The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever.</s> <s sid="5" id="OT.c12.s5">The worm does not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OT.c12.p3"><s sid="6" id="OT.c12.s6">Weak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream.</s> <s sid="7" id="OT.c12.s7">Feebly raising himself in the bed, with his head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="OT.c12.p6" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="OT.c12.s13"><qs/>'Hush, my dear,'<qe/> said the old lady softly.</s> <s sid="14" id="OT.c12.s14"><qs/>'You must be very quiet, or you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,--as bad as bad could be, pretty nigh.</s> <s sid="15" id="OT.c12.s15">Lie down again; there's a dear!'<qe/></s> <s sid="16" id="OT.c12.s16">With those words, the old lady very gently placed Oliver's head upon the pillow; and, smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers, and drawing it round his neck.</s> </p><p pid="7" id="OT.c12.p7" type="speech"><s sid="17" id="OT.c12.s17"><qs/>'Save us!'<qe/> said the old lady, with tears in her eyes.</s> <s sid="18" id="OT.c12.s18"><qs/>'What a grateful little dear it is.</s> <s sid="19" id="OT.c12.s19">Pretty creetur!</s> <s sid="20" id="OT.c12.s20">What would his mother feel if she had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="8" id="OT.c12.p8" type="speech"><s sid="21" id="OT.c12.s21"><qs/>'Perhaps she does see me,'<qe/><sls/> whispered Oliver, folding his hands together; <sle/><qs/>'perhaps she has sat by me.</s> <s sid="22" id="OT.c12.s22">I almost feel as if she had.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="9" id="OT.c12.p9" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="OT.c12.s23"><qs/>'That was the fever, my dear,'<qe/> said the old lady mildly.</s> </p><p pid="10" id="OT.c12.p10" type="speech"><s sid="24" id="OT.c12.s24"><qs/>'I suppose it was,'<qe/><sss/> replied Oliver, <sse/><qs/>'because heaven is a long way off; and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor boy.</s> <s sid="25" id="OT.c12.s25">But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there; for she was very ill herself before she died.</s> <s sid="26" id="OT.c12.s26">She can't know anything about me though,'<qe/> added Oliver after a moment's silence.</s> <s sid="27" id="OT.c12.s27"><qs/>'If she had seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="OT.c12.p11"><s sid="28" id="OT.c12.s28">The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver to drink; and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very quiet, or he would be ill again.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="OT.c12.p12"><s sid="29" id="OT.c12.s29">So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said.</s> <s sid="30" id="OT.c12.s30">He soon fell into a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a candle:  which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his pulse, and said he was a great deal better.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="OT.c12.p25"><s sid="54" id="OT.c12.s54">Oliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly twelve o'clock.</s> <s sid="55" id="OT.c12.s55">The old lady tenderly bade him good-night shortly afterwards, and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come:  bringing with her, in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a large nightcap.</s> <s sid="56" id="OT.c12.s56">Putting the latter on her head and the former on the table, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up with him, drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward, and divers moans and chokings.</s> <s sid="57" id="OT.c12.s57">These, however, had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep again.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="OT.c12.p26"><s sid="58" id="OT.c12.s58">And thus the night crept slowly on.</s> <s sid="59" id="OT.c12.s59">Oliver lay awake for some time, counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall.</s> <s sid="60" id="OT.c12.s60">The darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into the boy's mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many days and nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence, he turned his face upon the pillow, and fervently prayed to Heaven.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="OT.c12.p27"><s sid="61" id="OT.c12.s61">Gradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from.</s> <s sid="62" id="OT.c12.s62">Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present; its anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of the past!</s> </p>

<p pid="28" id="OT.c12.p28"><s sid="63" id="OT.c12.s63">It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt cheerful and happy.</s> <s sid="64" id="OT.c12.s64">The crisis of the disease was safely past.</s> <s sid="65" id="OT.c12.s65">He belonged to the world again.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="OT.c12.p29"><s sid="66" id="OT.c12.s66">In three days' time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped up with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper's room, which belonged to her.</s> <s sid="67" id="OT.c12.s67">Having him set, here, by the fire-side, the good old lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better, forthwith began to cry most violently.</s> </p>

<p pid="30" id="OT.c12.p30" type="speech"><s sid="68" id="OT.c12.s68"><qs/>'Never mind me, my dear,'<qe/><sss/> said the old lady; <sse/><qs/>'I'm only having a regular good cry.</s> <s sid="69" id="OT.c12.s69">There;

<p pid="64" id="OT.c12.p64"><s sid="136" id="OT.c12.s136">That when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined in the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver's heels, in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow's personal property, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need hardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid down as the main-springs of all Nature's deeds and actions:  the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady's proceedings to matters of maxim and theory:  and, by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling.</s> <s sid="137" id="OT.c12.s137">For, these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex.</s> </p>

<p pid="65" id="OT.c12.p65"><s sid="138" id="OT.c12.s138">If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when the general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut.</s> <s sid="139" id="OT.c12.s139">Although I do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages, to shorten the road to any great conclusion (their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge); still, I do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories, to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves.</s> <s sid="140" id="OT.c12.s140">Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and you may take any means which the end to be attained, will justify; the amount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher concerned, to be settled and determined by his clear, comprehensive, and impartial view of his own particular case.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c14.p2" type="speech"><s sid="4" id="OT.c14.s4"><qs/>'Ah!'<qe/> said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver's eyes.</s> <s sid="5" id="OT.c14.s5"><qs/>'It is gone, you see.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="3" id="OT.c14.p3" type="speech"><s sid="6" id="OT.c14.s6"><qs/>'I see it is ma'am,'<qe/> replied Oliver.</s> <s sid="7" id="OT.c14.s7"><qs/>'Why have they taken it away?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="4" id="OT.c14.p4" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="OT.c14.s8"><qs/>'It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you know,'<qe/> rejoined the old lady.</s> </p><p pid="5" id="OT.c14.p5" type="speech"><s sid="9" id="OT.c14.s9"><qs/>'Oh, no, indeed.</s> <s sid="10" id="OT.c14.s10">It didn't worry me, ma'am,'<qe/> said Oliver.</s> <s sid="11" id="OT.c14.s11"><qs/>'I liked to see it.</s> <s sid="12" id="OT.c14.s12">I quite loved it.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="OT.c14.p6" type="speech"><s sid="13" id="OT.c14.s13"><qs/>'Well, well!'<qe/><sls/> said the old lady, good-humouredly; <sle/><qs/>'you get well as fast as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again.</s> <s sid="14" id="OT.c14.s14">There!</s> <s sid="15" id="OT.c14.s15">I promise you that!</s> <s sid="16" id="OT.c14.s16">Now, let us talk about something else.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="7" id="OT.c14.p7"><s sid="17" id="OT.c14.s17">This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at that time.</s> <s sid="18" id="OT.c14.s18">As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome man, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man, and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year, that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them.</s> <s sid="19" id="OT.c14.s19">When the old lady had expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her children, and the merits of her kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone, poor dear soul! just six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea.</s> <s sid="20" id="OT.c14.s20">After tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as quickly as she could teach:  and at which game they played, with great interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily to bed.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="OT.c14.p8"><s sid="21" id="OT.c14.s21">They were happy days, those of Oliver's recovery.</s> <s sid="22" id="OT.c14.s22">Everything was so quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it seemed like Heaven itself.</s> <s sid="23" id="OT.c14.s23">He was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and a new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him.</s> <s sid="24" id="OT.c14.s24">As Oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself.</s> <s sid="25" id="OT.c14.s25">This she very readily did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew roll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again.</s> <s sid="26" id="OT.c14.s26">They were sad rags, to tell the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="OT.c14.p9"><s sid="27" id="OT.c14.s27">One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr. Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see him in his study, and talk to him a little while.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="OT.c14.p10" type="speech"><s sid="28" id="OT.c14.s28"><qs/>'Bless us, and save us!</s> <s sid="29" id="OT.c14.s29">Wash your hands, and let me part your hair nicely for you, child,'<qe/> said Mrs. Bedwin.</s> <s sid="30" id="OT.c14.s30"><qs/>'Dear heart alive!</s> <s sid="31" id="OT.c14.s31">If we had known he would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean collar on, and made you as smart as sixpence!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="11" id="OT.c14.p11"><s sid="32" id="OT.c14.s32">Oliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirt-collar; he looked so delicate and handsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she went so far as to say:  looking at him with great complacency from head to foot, that she really didn't think it would have been possible, on the longest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="OT.c14.p12"><s sid="33" id="OT.c14.s33">Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door.</s> <s sid="34" id="OT.c14.s34">On Mr. Brownlow calling to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room, quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little gardens.</s> <s sid="35" id="OT.c14.s35">There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr. Brownlow was seated reading.</s> <s sid="36" id="OT.c14.s36">When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book away from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down.</s> <s sid="37" id="OT.c14.s37">Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser.</s> <s sid="38" id="OT.c14.s38">Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver Twist, every day of their lives.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="OT.c14.p13" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="OT.c14.s39"><qs/>'There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?'<qe/> said Mr. Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.</s> </p><p pid="14" id="OT.c14.p14" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="OT.c14.s40"><qs/>'A great number, sir,'<qe/> replied Oliver.</s> <s sid="41" id="OT.c14.s41"><qs/>'I never saw so many.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="15" id="OT.c14.p15" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="OT.c14.s42"><qs/>'You shall read them, if you behave well,'<qe/><sls/> said the old gentleman kindly; <sle/><qs/>'and you will like that, better than looking at the outsides,--that is, some cases; because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="16" id="OT.c14.p16" type="speech"><s sid="43" id="OT.c14.s43"><qs/>'I suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,'<qe/> said Oliver, pointing to some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding.</s> </p><p pid="17" id="OT.c14.p17" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="OT.c14.s44"><qs/>'Not always those,'<qe/><sls/> said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head, and smiling as he did so; <sle/><qs/>'there are other equally heavy ones, though of a much smaller size.</s> <s sid="45" id="OT.c14.s45">How should you like to grow up a clever man, and write books, eh?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="18" id="OT.c14.p18" type="speech"><s sid="46" id="OT.c14.s46"><qs/>'I think I would rather read them, sir,'<qe/> replied Oliver.</s> </p><p pid="19" id="OT.c14.p19" type="speech"><s sid="47" id="OT.c14.s47"><qs/>'What! wouldn't you like to be a book-writer?'<qe/> said the old gentleman.</s> </p><p pid="20" id="OT.c14.p20"><s sid="48" id="OT.c14.s48">Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it would be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing.</s> <s sid="49" id="OT.c14.s49">Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it was.</s> </p>

<p pid="21" id="OT.c14.p21" type="speech"><s sid="50" id="OT.c14.s50"><qs/>'Well, well,'<qe/> said the old gentleman, composing his features.</s> <s sid="51" id="OT.c14.s51"><qs/>'Don't be afraid!</s> <s sid="52" id="OT.c14.s52">We won't make an author of you, while there's an honest trade to be learnt, or brick-making to turn to.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="22" id="OT.c14.p22" type="speech"><s sid="53" id="OT.c14.s53"><qs/>'Thank you, sir,'<qe/> said Oliver.</s> <s sid="54" id="OT.c14.s54">At the earnest manner of his reply, the old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention to.</s> </p><p pid="23" id="OT.c14.p23" type="speech"><s sid="55" id="OT.c14.s55"><qs/>'Now,'<qe/><sls/> said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him assume yet, <sle/><qs/>'I want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am going to say.</s> <s sid="56" id="OT.c14.s56">I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am sure you are well able to understand me, as many older persons would be.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="24" id="OT.c14.p24" type="speech"><s sid="57" id="OT.c14.s57"><qs/>'Oh, don't tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!'<qe/> exclaimed Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman's commencement!</s> <s sid="58" id="OT.c14.s58"><qs/>'Don't turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again.</s> <s sid="59" id="OT.c14.s59">Let me stay here, and be a servant.</s> <s sid="60" id="OT.c14.s60">Don't send me back to the wretched place I came from.</s> <s sid="61" id="OT.c14.s61">Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="25" id="OT.c14.p25" type="speech"><s sid="62" id="OT.c14.s62"><qs/>'My dear child,'<qe/><sls/> said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of Oliver's sudden appeal; <sle/><qs/>'you need not be afraid of my deserting you, unless you give me cause.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="26" id="OT.c14.p26" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="OT.c14.s63"><qs/>'I never, never will, sir,'<qe/> interposed Oliver.</s> </p><p pid="27" id="OT.c14.p27" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="OT.c14.s64"><qs/>'I hope not,'<qe/> rejoined the old gentleman.</s> <s sid="65" id="OT.c14.s65"><qs/>'I do not think you ever will.</s> <s sid="66" id="OT.c14.s66">I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you, nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well account for, even to myself.</s> <s sid="67" id="OT.c14.s67">The persons on whom I have bestowed my dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections.</s> <s sid="68" id="OT.c14.s68">Deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="28" id="OT.c14.p28"><s sid="69" id="OT.c14.s69">As the old gentleman said this in a low voice:  more to himself than to his companion:  and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards:</s> <s sid="70" id="OT.c14.s70">Oliver sat quite still.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="OT.c14.p29" type="speech"><s sid="71" id="OT.c14.s71"><qs/>'Well, well!'<qe/><sls/> said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful tone, <sle/><qs/>'I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful, perhaps, not to wound me again.</s> <s sid="72" id="OT.c14.s72">You say you are an orphan, without a friend in the world; all the inquiries I have been able to make, confirm the statement.</s> <s sid="73" id="OT.c14.s73">Let me hear your story; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found you.</s> <s sid="74" id="OT.c14.s74">Speak the truth, and you shall not be friendless while I live.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="30" id="OT.c14.p30"><s sid="75" id="OT.c14.s75">Oliver's sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly impatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door:  and the servant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.</s> </p>

<p pid="31" id="OT.c14.p31" type="speech"><s sid="76" id="OT.c14.s76"><qs/>'Is he coming up?'<qe/> inquired Mr. Brownlow.</s> </p><p pid="32" id="OT.c14.p32" type="speech"><s sid="77" id="OT.c14.s77"><qs/>'Yes, sir,'<qe/> replied the servant.</s> <s sid="78" id="OT.c14.s78"><qs/>'He asked if there were any muffins in the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="33" id="OT.c14.p33"><s sid="79" id="OT.c14.s79">Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was an old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason to know.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="OT.c14.p34" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="OT.c14.s80"><qs/>'Shall I go downstairs, sir?'<qe/> inquired Oliver.</s> </p><p pid="35" id="OT.c14.p35" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="OT.c14.s81"><qs/>'No,'<qe/><sss/> replied Mr. Brownlow, <sse/><qs/>'I would rather you remained here.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="36" id="OT.c14.p36"><s sid="82" id="OT.c14.s82">At this moment, there walked into the room:  supporting himself by a thick stick:  a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with green.</s> <s sid="83" id="OT.c14.s83">A very small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat; and a very long steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end, dangled loosely below it.</s> <s sid="84" id="OT.c14.s84">The ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted, defy description.</s> <s sid="85" id="OT.c14.s85">He had a manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time:  which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot.</s> <s sid="86" id="OT.c14.s86">In this attitude, he fixed himself, the moment he made his appearance; and, holding out a small piece of orange-peel at arm's length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented voice.</s> </p>

<p pid="37" id="OT.c14.p37" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="OT.c14.s87"><qs/>'Look here! do you see this!</s> <s sid="88" id="OT.c14.s88">Isn't it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that I can't call at a man's house but I find a piece of this poor surgeon's friend on the staircase?</s> <s sid="89" id="OT.c14.s89">I've been lamed with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I'll be content to eat my own head, sir!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="38" id="OT.c14.p38"><s sid="90" id="OT.c14.s90">This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed, Mr. Grimwig's head was such a particularly large one, that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sitting--to put entirely out of the question, a very thick coating of powder.</s> </p>

<p pid="39" id="OT.c14.p39" type="speech"><s sid="91" id="OT.c14.s91"><qs/>'I'll eat my head, sir,'<qe/> repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon the ground.</s> <s sid="92" id="OT.c14.s92"><qs/>'Hallo! what's that!'<qe/> looking at Oliver, and retreating a pace or two.</s> </p><p pid="40" id="OT.c14.p40" type="speech"><s sid="93" id="OT.c14.s93"><qs/>'This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,'<qe/> said Mr. Brownlow.</s> </p><p pid="41" id="OT.c14.p41"><s sid="94" id="OT.c14.s94">Oliver bowed.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XV SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY WERE</title>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c15.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c15.s1">In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer:  there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as Mr. William Sikes.</s> <s sid="2" id="OT.c15.s2">At his feet, sat a white-coated, red-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh cut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c15.p2" type="speech"><s sid="3" id="OT.c15.s3"><qs/>'Keep quiet, you warmint!</s> <s sid="4" id="OT.c15.s4">Keep quiet!'<qe/> said Mr. Sikes, suddenly breaking silence.</s> <s sid="5" id="OT.c15.s5">Whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dog's winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for argument and consideration.</s> <s sid="6" id="OT.c15.s6">Whatever was the cause, the effect was a kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.</s> </p><p pid="3" id="OT.c15.p3"><s sid="7" id="OT.c15.s7">Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters; but Mr. Sikes's dog, having faults of temper in common with his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the half-boots.</s> <s sid="8" id="OT.c15.s8">Having given in a hearty shake, he retired, growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his head.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XVIII HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE FRIENDS</title>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c18.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c18.s1">About noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary extent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery.</s> <s sid="2" id="OT.c18.s2">Mr. Fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and cherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished with hunger; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom, in his philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be hanged at the Old Bailey one morning.</s> <s sid="3" id="OT.c18.s3">Mr. Fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question, had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not precisely true, was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr.</s> <s sid="4" id="OT.c18.s4">Fagin) and a few select friends.</s> <s sid="5" id="OT.c18.s5">Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with great friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant operation.</s> </p>

<p pid="19" id="OT.c26.p19"><s sid="38" id="OT.c26.s38">As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over the keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a song; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he could.</s> <s sid="39" id="OT.c26.s39">When this was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the professional gentleman on the chairman's right and left volunteered a duet, and sang it, with great applause.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XXVII ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY, MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY</title>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c27.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c27.s1">As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less become his station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words--trusting that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated--hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at his hands.</s> <s sid="2" id="OT.c27.s2">Towards this end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong:  which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by want of time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that a beadle properly constituted:  that is to say, a parochial beadle, attached to a parochail workhouse, and attending in his official capacity the parochial church:  is, in right and virtue of his office, possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and that to none of those excellences, can mere companies' beadles, or court-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles (save the last, and they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the remotest sustainable claim.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c27.p2"><s sid="3" id="OT.c27.s3">Mr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs, made a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times; before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return.</s> <s sid="4" id="OT.c27.s4">Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney's approach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney's chest of drawers.</s> </p>

<p pid="59" id="OT.c32.p59"><s sid="149" id="OT.c32.s149">In the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o'clock, roaming the fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild flowers, with which he would return laden, home; and which it took great care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the embellishment of the breakfast-table.</s> <s sid="150" id="OT.c32.s150">There was fresh groundsel, too, for Miss Maylie's birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the cages, in the most approved taste.</s> <s sid="151" id="OT.c32.s151">When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare cricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which Oliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who was a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good-will, until Miss Rose made her appearance:  when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done.</s> </p>

<p pid="60" id="OT.c32.p60"><s sid="152" id="OT.c32.s152">So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled happiness, and which, in Oliver's were true felicity.</s> <s sid="153" id="OT.c32.s153">With the purest and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest, soul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of that short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment to, himself.</s> </p></div>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c37.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c37.s1">Mr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which were sent back from its cold and shining surface.</s> <s sid="2" id="OT.c37.s2">A paper fly-cage dangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance.</s> <s sid="3" id="OT.c37.s3">Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might be that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own past life.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c37.p2"><s sid="4" id="OT.c37.s4">Nor was Mr. Bumble's gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator.</s> <s sid="5" id="OT.c37.s5">There were not wanting other appearances, and those closely connected with his own person, which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs.</s> <s sid="6" id="OT.c37.s6">The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they?</s> <s sid="7" id="OT.c37.s7">He still wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs; but they were not _the_ breeches.</s> <s sid="8" id="OT.c37.s8">The coat was wide-skirted; and in that respect like _the_ coat, but, oh how different!</s> <s sid="9" id="OT.c37.s9">The mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one.</s> <s sid="10" id="OT.c37.s10">Mr. Bumble was no longer a beadle.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OT.c37.p3"><s sid="11" id="OT.c37.s11">There are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more substantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them.</s> <s sid="12" id="OT.c37.s12">A field-marshal has his uniform; a bishop his silk apron; a counsellor his silk gown; a beadle his cocked hat.</s> <s sid="13" id="OT.c37.s13">Strip the bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his hat and lace; what are they?</s> <s sid="14" id="OT.c37.s14">Men.</s> <s sid="15" id="OT.c37.s15">Mere men.</s> <s sid="16" id="OT.c37.s16">Dignity, and even holiness too, sometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OT.c37.p4"><s sid="17" id="OT.c37.s17">Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse.</s> <s sid="18" id="OT.c37.s18">Another beadle had come into power.</s> <s sid="19" id="OT.c37.s19">On him the cocked hat, gold-laced coat, and staff, had all three descended.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="OT.c37.p5" type="speech"><s sid="20" id="OT.c37.s20"><qs/>'And to-morrow two months it was done!'<qe/> said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh.</s> <s sid="21" id="OT.c37.s21"><qs/>'It seems a age.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="OT.c37.p6"><s sid="22" id="OT.c37.s22">Mr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh--there was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="OT.c37.p7" type="speech"><s sid="23" id="OT.c37.s23"><qs/>'I sold myself,'<qe/><sls/> said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection, <sle/><qs/>'for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small quantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money.</s> <s sid="24" id="OT.c37.s24">I went very reasonable.</s> <s sid="25" id="OT.c37.s25">Cheap, dirt cheap!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="8" id="OT.c37.p8" type="speech"><s sid="26" id="OT.c37.s26"><qs/>'Cheap!'<qe/> cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble's ear:</s> <s sid="27" id="OT.c37.s27"><qs/>'you would have been dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows that!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="9" id="OT.c37.p9"><s sid="28" id="OT.c37.s28">Mr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort, who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="OT.c37.p10" type="speech"><s sid="29" id="OT.c37.s29"><qs/>'Mrs. Bumble, ma'am!'<qe/> said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness.</s> </p><p pid="11" id="OT.c37.p11" type="speech"><s sid="30" id="OT.c37.s30"><qs/>'Well!'<qe/> cried the lady.</s> </p><p pid="12" id="OT.c37.p12" type="speech"><s sid="31" id="OT.c37.s31"><qs/>'Have the goodness to look at me,'<qe/> said Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes upon her.</s> <s sid="32" id="OT.c37.s32">(If she stands such a eye as that,<qs/>' said Mr. Bumble to himself, 'she can stand anything.</s> <s sid="33" id="OT.c37.s33">It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers.</s> <s sid="34" id="OT.c37.s34">If it fails with her, my power is gone.'<qe/>)</s> </p><p pid="13" id="OT.c37.p13"><s sid="35" id="OT.c37.s35">Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle glances; are matters of opinion.</s> <s sid="36" id="OT.c37.s36">The matter of fact, is, that the matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble's scowl, but, on the contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="OT.c37.p14"><s sid="37" id="OT.c37.s37">On hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first incredulous, and afterwards amazed.</s> <s sid="38" id="OT.c37.s38">He then relapsed into his former state; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="OT.c37.p15" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="OT.c37.s39"><qs/>'Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?'<qe/> inquired Mrs. Bumble.</s> </p><p pid="16" id="OT.c37.p16" type="speech"><s sid="40" id="OT.c37.s40"><qs/>'I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma'am,'<qe/><sss/> rejoined Mr. Bumble; <sse/><qs/>'and although I was _not_ snoring, I shall snore, gape, sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my prerogative.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="17" id="OT.c37.p17" type="speech"><s sid="41" id="OT.c37.s41"><qs/>'_Your_ prerogative!'<qe/> sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable contempt.</s> </p><p pid="18" id="OT.c37.p18" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="OT.c37.s42"><qs/>'I said the word, ma'am,'<qe/> said Mr. Bumble.</s> <s sid="43" id="OT.c37.s43"><qs/>'The prerogative of a man is to command.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="OT.c37.p19" type="speech"><s sid="44" id="OT.c37.s44"><qs/>'And what's the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?'<qe/> cried the relict of Mr. Corney deceased.</s> </p><p pid="20" id="OT.c37.p20" type="speech"><s sid="45" id="OT.c37.s45"><qs/>'To obey, ma'am,'<qe/> thundered Mr. Bumble.</s> <s sid="46" id="OT.c37.s46"><qs/>'Your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might have been alive now.</s> <s sid="47" id="OT.c37.s47">I wish he was, poor man!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="21" id="OT.c37.p21"><s sid="48" id="OT.c37.s48">Mrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now arrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a paroxysm of tears.</s> </p>

<p pid="22" id="OT.c37.p22"><s sid="49" id="OT.c37.s49">But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble's soul; his heart was waterproof.</s> <s sid="50" id="OT.c37.s50">Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain, his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of his own power, pleased and exalted him.</s> <s sid="51" id="OT.c37.s51">He eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that she should cry her hardest:  the exercise being looked upon, by the faculty, as strongly conducive to health.</s> </p>

<p pid="23" id="OT.c37.p23" type="speech"><s sid="52" id="OT.c37.s52"><qs/>'It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and softens down the temper,'<qe/> said Mr. Bumble.</s> <s sid="53" id="OT.c37.s53"><qs/>'So cry away.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="24" id="OT.c37.p24"><s sid="54" id="OT.c37.s54">As he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his hat from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man might, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner, thrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance.</s> </p>

<p pid="25" id="OT.c37.p25"><s sid="55" id="OT.c37.s55">Now, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in discovering.</s> </p>

<p pid="26" id="OT.c37.p26"><s sid="56" id="OT.c37.s56">The first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room.</s> <s sid="57" id="OT.c37.s57">This preliminary proceeding laying bare his head, the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and dexterity) upon it with the other.</s> <s sid="58" id="OT.c37.s58">This done, she created a little variety by scratching his face, and tearing his hair; and, having, by this time, inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence, she pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated for the purpose:  and defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if he dared.</s> </p>

<p pid="27" id="OT.c37.p27" type="speech"><s sid="59" id="OT.c37.s59"><qs/>'Get up!'<qe/> said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command.</s> <s sid="60" id="OT.c37.s60"><qs/>'And take yourself away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="28" id="OT.c37.p28"><s sid="61" id="OT.c37.s61">Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance:  wondering much what something desperate might be.</s> <s sid="62" id="OT.c37.s62">Picking up his hat, he looked towards the door.</s> </p>

<p pid="29" id="OT.c37.p29" type="speech"><s sid="63" id="OT.c37.s63"><qs/>'Are you going?'<qe/> demanded Mrs. Bumble.</s> </p><p pid="30" id="OT.c37.p30" type="speech"><s sid="64" id="OT.c37.s64"><qs/>'Certainly, my dear, certainly,'<qe/> rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker motion towards the door.</s> <s sid="65" id="OT.c37.s65"><qs/>'I didn't intend to--I'm going, my dear!</s> <s sid="66" id="OT.c37.s66">You are so very violent, that really I--'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="31" id="OT.c37.p31"><s sid="67" id="OT.c37.s67">At this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle.</s> <s sid="68" id="OT.c37.s68">Mr. Bumble immediately darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence:  leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full possession of the field.</s> </p>

<p pid="32" id="OT.c37.p32"><s sid="69" id="OT.c37.s69">Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten.</s> <s sid="70" id="OT.c37.s70">He had a decided propensity for bullying:  derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is needless to say) a coward.</s> <s sid="71" id="OT.c37.s71">This is by no means a disparagement to his character; for many official personages, who are held in high respect and admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities.</s> <s sid="72" id="OT.c37.s72">The remark is made, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise, and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office.</s> </p>

<p pid="33" id="OT.c37.p33"><s sid="73" id="OT.c37.s73">But, the measure of his degradation was not yet full.</s> <s sid="74" id="OT.c37.s74">After making a tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their wives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be visited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen:  when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded.</s> </p>

<p pid="34" id="OT.c37.p34" type="speech"><s sid="75" id="OT.c37.s75"><qs/>'Hem!'<qe/> said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity.</s> <s sid="76" id="OT.c37.s76"><qs/>'These women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative.</s> <s sid="77" id="OT.c37.s77">Hallo! hallo there!</s> <s sid="78" id="OT.c37.s78">What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="35" id="OT.c37.p35"><s sid="79" id="OT.c37.s79">With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner:  which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife.</s> </p>

<p pid="36" id="OT.c37.p36" type="speech"><s sid="80" id="OT.c37.s80"><qs/>'My dear,'<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Bumble, <sse/><qs/>'I didn't know you were here.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="37" id="OT.c37.p37" type="speech"><s sid="81" id="OT.c37.s81"><qs/>'Didn't know I was here!'<qe/> repeated Mrs. Bumble.</s> <s sid="82" id="OT.c37.s82"><qs/>'What do _you_ do here?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="38" id="OT.c37.p38" type="speech"><s sid="83" id="OT.c37.s83"><qs/>'I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly, my dear,'<qe/> replied Mr. Bumble:  glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhouse-master's humility.</s> </p><p pid="39" id="OT.c37.p39" type="speech"><s sid="84" id="OT.c37.s84"><qs/>'_You_ thought they were talking too much?'<qe/> said Mrs. Bumble.</s> <s sid="85" id="OT.c37.s85"><qs/>'What business is it of yours?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="40" id="OT.c37.p40" type="speech"><s sid="86" id="OT.c37.s86"><qs/>'Why, my dear--'<qe/> urged Mr. Bumble submissively.</s> </p><p pid="41" id="OT.c37.p41" type="speech"><s sid="87" id="OT.c37.s87"><qs/>'What business is it of yours?'<qe/> demanded Mrs. Bumble, again.</s> </p><p pid="42" id="OT.c37.p42" type="speech"><s sid="88" id="OT.c37.s88"><qs/>'It's very true, you're matron here, my dear,'<qe/><sss/> submitted Mr. Bumble; <sse/><qs/>'but I thought you mightn't be in the way just then.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="43" id="OT.c37.p43" type="speech"><s sid="89" id="OT.c37.s89"><qs/>'I'll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,'<qe/> returned his lady.</s> <s sid="90" id="OT.c37.s90"><qs/>'We don't want any of your interference.</s> <s sid="91" id="OT.c37.s91">You're a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that don't concern you, making everybody in the house laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day.</s> <s sid="92" id="OT.c37.s92">Be off; come!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="44" id="OT.c37.p44"><s sid="93" id="OT.c37.s93">Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated for an instant.</s> <s sid="94" id="OT.c37.s94">Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught up a bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him instantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person.</s> </p>

<p pid="45" id="OT.c37.p45"><s sid="95" id="OT.c37.s95">What could Mr. Bumble do?</s> <s sid="96" id="OT.c37.s96">He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away; and, as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight.</s> <s sid="97" id="OT.c37.s97">It wanted but this.</s> <s sid="98" id="OT.c37.s98">He was degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very paupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery.</s> </p>

<p pid="46" id="OT.c37.p46" type="speech"><s sid="99" id="OT.c37.s99"><qs/>'All in two months!'<qe/> said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts.</s> <s sid="100" id="OT.c37.s100"><qs/>'Two months!</s> <s sid="101" id="OT.c37.s101">No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master, but everybody else's, so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned, and now!--'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="47" id="OT.c37.p47"><s sid="102" id="OT.c37.s102">It was too much.</s> <s sid="103" id="OT.c37.s103">Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and walked, distractedly, into the street.</s> </p>

<p pid="48" id="OT.c37.p48"><s sid="104" id="OT.c37.s104">He walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty.</s> <s sid="105" id="OT.c37.s105">He passed a great many public-houses; but, at length paused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary customer.</s> <s sid="106" id="OT.c37.s106">It began to rain, heavily, at the moment.</s> <s sid="107" id="OT.c37.s107">This determined him.</s> <s sid="108" id="OT.c37.s108">Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street.</s> </p>

<p pid="49" id="OT.c37.p49"><s sid="109" id="OT.c37.s109">The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large cloak.</s> <s sid="110" id="OT.c37.s110">He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain haggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to have travelled some distance.</s> <s sid="111" id="OT.c37.s111">He eyed Bumble askance, as he entered, but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation.</s> </p>

<p pid="50" id="OT.c37.p50"><s sid="112" id="OT.c37.s112">Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar:  so he drank his gin-and-water in silence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.</s> </p>

<p pid="51" id="OT.c37.p51"><s sid="113" id="OT.c37.s113">It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall into company under such circumstances:  that Mr. Bumble felt, every now and then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a look at the stranger:  and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him.</s> <s sid="114" id="OT.c37.s114">Mr. Bumble's awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the stranger's eye, which was keen and bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike anything he had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XXXVIII CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND MR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW</title>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c38.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c38.s1">It was a dull, close, overcast summer evening.</s> <s sid="2" id="OT.c38.s2">The clouds, which had been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half, or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon the river.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c38.p2"><s sid="3" id="OT.c38.s3">They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might, perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain, and sheltering them from observation.</s> <s sid="4" id="OT.c38.s4">The husband carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as though--the way being dirty--to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints.</s> <s sid="5" id="OT.c38.s5">They went on, in profound silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then, discovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards their place of destination.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OT.c38.p3"><s sid="6" id="OT.c38.s6">This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime.</s> <s sid="7" id="OT.c38.s7">It was a collection of mere hovels:  some, hastily built with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for the most part, within a few feet of the river's bank.</s> <s sid="8" id="OT.c38.s8">A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it:  and here and there an oar or coil of rope:  appeared, at first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a passer-by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with any view to their being actually employed.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OT.c38.p4"><s sid="9" id="OT.c38.s9">In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of some kind.</s> <s sid="10" id="OT.c38.s10">It had, in its day, probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements.</s> <s sid="11" id="OT.c38.s11">But it had long since gone to ruin.</s> <s sid="12" id="OT.c38.s12">The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving itself in the same fate.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="OT.c38.p5"><s sid="13" id="OT.c38.s13">It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring violently down.</s> </p>

<title>CHAPTER XXXIX INTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS TOGETHER</title>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c39.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c39.s1">On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c39.p2"><s sid="2" id="OT.c39.s2">The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings.</s> <s sid="3" id="OT.c39.s3">It was not, in appearance, so desirable a habitation as his old quarters:  being a mean and badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty lane.</s> <s sid="4" id="OT.c39.s4">Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman's having gone down in the world of late:  for a great scarcity of furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen, bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OT.c39.p3"><s sid="5" id="OT.c39.s5">The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat, by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week's growth.</s> <s sid="6" id="OT.c39.s6">The dog sat at the bedside:  now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention.</s> <s sid="7" id="OT.c39.s7">Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robber's ordinary dress, was a female:  so pale and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to Mr. Sikes's question.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OT.c39.p4" type="speech"><s sid="8" id="OT.c39.s8"><qs/>'Not long gone seven,'<qe/> said the girl.</s> <s sid="9" id="OT.c39.s9"><qs/>'How do you feel to-night, Bill?'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="5" id="OT.c39.p5" type="speech"><s sid="10" id="OT.c39.s10"><qs/>'As weak as water,'<qe/> replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs.</s> <s sid="11" id="OT.c39.s11"><qs/>'Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="6" id="OT.c39.p6"><s sid="12" id="OT.c39.s12">Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes's temper; for, as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her awkwardness, and struck her.</s> </p>

<p pid="17" id="OT.c39.p17" type="speech"><s sid="38" id="OT.c39.s38"><qs/>'What's the matter here, my dear?'<qe/> said Fagin, looking in.</s> </p><p pid="18" id="OT.c39.p18" type="speech"><s sid="39" id="OT.c39.s39"><qs/>'Lend a hand to the girl, can't you?'<qe/> replied Sikes impatiently.</s> <s sid="40" id="OT.c39.s40"><qs/>'Don't stand chattering and grinning at me!'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="19" id="OT.c39.p19"><s sid="41" id="OT.c39.s41">With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl's assistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents down the patient's throat:  previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes.</s> </p>

<p pid="20" id="OT.c39.p20" type="speech"><s sid="42" id="OT.c39.s42"><qs/>'Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,'<qe/><sss/> said Mr. Dawkins; <sse/><qs/>'and you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the petticuts.'<qe/></s> </p><p pid="21" id="OT.c39.p21"><s sid="43" id="OT.c39.s43">These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially that department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry:  were not long in producing the desired effect.</s> <s sid="44" id="OT.c39.s44">The girl gradually recovered her senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon the pillow:  leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance.</s> </p>

<p pid="1" id="OT.c53.p1"><s sid="1" id="OT.c53.s1">The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed.</s> <s sid="2" id="OT.c53.s2">The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few and simple words.</s> </p>

<p pid="2" id="OT.c53.p2"><s sid="3" id="OT.c53.s3">Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young clergyman's labours; on the same day they entered into possession of their new and happy home.</s> </p>

<p pid="3" id="OT.c53.p3"><s sid="4" id="OT.c53.s4">Mrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law, to enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity that age and worth can know--the contemplation of the happiness of those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent life, have been unceasingly bestowed.</s> </p>

<p pid="4" id="OT.c53.p4"><s sid="5" id="OT.c53.s5">It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of property remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than three thousand pounds.</s> <s sid="6" id="OT.c53.s6">By the provisions of his father's will, Oliver would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to which his young charge joyfully acceded.</s> </p>

<p pid="5" id="OT.c53.p5"><s sid="7" id="OT.c53.s7">Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk under an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison.</s> <s sid="8" id="OT.c53.s8">As far from home, died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin's gang.</s> </p>

<p pid="6" id="OT.c53.p6"><s sid="9" id="OT.c53.s9">Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son.</s> <s sid="10" id="OT.c53.s10">Removing with him and the old housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver's warm and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in this changing world.</s> </p>

<p pid="7" id="OT.c53.p7"><s sid="11" id="OT.c53.s11">Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how.</s> <s sid="12" id="OT.c53.s12">For two or three months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to disagree with him; then, finding that the place really no longer was, to him, what it had been, he settled his business on his assistant, took a bachelor's cottage outside the village of which his young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered.</s> <s sid="13" id="OT.c53.s13">Here he took to gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits of a similar kind:  all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity.</s> <s sid="14" id="OT.c53.s14">In each and all he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood, as a most profound authority.</s> </p>

<p pid="8" id="OT.c53.p8"><s sid="15" id="OT.c53.s15">Before his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for Mr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated.</s> <s sid="16" id="OT.c53.s16">He is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course of the year.</s> <s sid="17" id="OT.c53.s17">On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration, that his mode is the right one.</s> <s sid="18" id="OT.c53.s18">On Sundays, he never fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman's face:  always informing Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say so.</s> <s sid="19" id="OT.c53.s19">It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his return; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in proof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which always calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour.</s> </p>

<p pid="9" id="OT.c53.p9"><s sid="20" id="OT.c53.s20">Mr. Noah Claypole:  receiving a free pardon from the Crown in consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin:  and considering his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish:  was, for some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened with too much work.</s> <s sid="21" id="OT.c53.s21">After some consideration, he went into business as an Informer, in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence.</s> <s sid="22" id="OT.c53.s22">His plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by Charlotte in respectable attire.</s> <s sid="23" id="OT.c53.s23">The lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with three-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next day, and pockets half the penalty.</s> <s sid="24" id="OT.c53.s24">Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints himself, but the result is the same.</s> </p>

<p pid="10" id="OT.c53.p10"><s sid="25" id="OT.c53.s25">Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others.</s> <s sid="26" id="OT.c53.s26">Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation, he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife.</s> </p>

<p pid="11" id="OT.c53.p11"><s sid="27" id="OT.c53.s27">As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts, although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey.</s> <s sid="28" id="OT.c53.s28">They sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among its inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they properly belong.</s> </p>

<p pid="12" id="OT.c53.p12"><s sid="29" id="OT.c53.s29">Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes's crime, fell into a train of reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best.</s> <s sid="30" id="OT.c53.s30">Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action.</s> <s sid="31" id="OT.c53.s31">He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a farmer's drudge, and a carrier's lad, he is now the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire.</s> </p>

<p pid="13" id="OT.c53.p13"><s sid="32" id="OT.c53.s32">And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space, the thread of these adventures.</s> </p>

<p pid="14" id="OT.c53.p14"><s sid="33" id="OT.c53.s33">I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it.</s> <s sid="34" id="OT.c53.s34">I would show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood, shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell on all who trod it with her, and shone into their hearts.</s> <s sid="35" id="OT.c53.s35">I would paint her the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively summer group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and her dead sister's child happy in their love for one another, and passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle; I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye.</s> <s sid="36" id="OT.c53.s36">These, and a thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech--I would fain recall them every one.</s> </p>

<p pid="15" id="OT.c53.p15"><s sid="37" id="OT.c53.s37">How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him, more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving seeds of all he wished him to become--how he traced in him new traits of his early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances, melancholy and yet sweet and soothing--how the two orphans, tried by adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them--these are all matters which need not to be told.</s> <s sid="38" id="OT.c53.s38">I have said that they were truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be attained.</s> </p>
